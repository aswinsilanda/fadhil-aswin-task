He ignores his daughter, Murph, when she claims a ghost is communicating to her through her bookshelf, but later finds dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph\'s bedroom floor. He investigates, arriving at a secret NASA facility where Professor Brand explains that blight, dust storms and failing crops have rendered humanity incapable of surviving on Earth. NASA\'s current, secret mission involves engineering a way for humans to escape the Earth while finding another habitable planet. Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this possible, and asks Cooper to pilot the mission. Cooper agrees, promising a distraught Murph that he will return. He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft Endurance. The ship is headed towards a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn decades ago.\r\nThe Endurance passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua. The crew intends to investigate three planets, each previously explored by NASA volunteers, who shared positive reports for habitability. The first planet is an aqua planet with massive tidal waves and no dry land. Doyle drowns, and Amelia and Cooper fly back to the Endurance, only to find that decades have passed due to the time slippage caused by the planet\'s proximity to Gargantua. Romilly, having remained onboard, has aged twenty-three years. Cooper replays messages from Earth, learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand.\r\nThe crew journey to the second planet, where its previous investigator, Mann, falsified data to ensure a NASA mission to his planet so he could be rescued. Romilly is killed by Mann\'s booby-trap, and Mann attempts to hijack the Endurance but fails to dock properly, blowing out the hatch and killing himself in the process. Cooper and Amelia catch up with the damaged Endurance and dock safely. With limited resources available to use their engines, Cooper proposes a slingshot move around Gargantua, using its gravity to propel them toward the final planet. To shed weight, Cooper sacrifices himself at the last minute, dropping into the black hole and leaving Amelia to complete the journey.\r\nFalling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract. He deduces that it was placed there by future humans with access to higher dimensions, as was the wormhole. He realizes that by using gravity, he is able to send messages to Murph and his past self. On Earth, Murph visits her childhood house after Professor Brand\'s death. She finds her father\'s old watch on her bookshelf, and notices the seconds-hand moving irregularly. She initially believes her ""ghost"" is back, only to realize that it was Cooper all along, sending her messages from a higher dimension. Cooper feeds Murph scientific data about the black hole\'s singularity, which she eventually uses to solve the gravity-equation, helping humanity escape the Earth.\r\nHis mission is now complete, and Cooper is ejected by future beings from the tesseract. He is sent back through the wormhole and picked up by a ranger orbiting Saturn. Due to the time slippage around Gargantua, almost ninety years have passed in Earth-time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a space station and reunites with Murph, now a celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction. Nearing death, she advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die, and urges him to find Brand, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets off on his new journey. On the other planet, Amelia is building a new colony for future humans to inhabit. She removes her helmet and breathes the air, showing that the planet is capable of supporting life.\r\nCast\r\nMatthew McConaughey as Joseph Cooper, a widowed NASA pilot who, after the agency was closed by the government, had become a farmer\r\nAnne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, a NASA scientist, and astronaut\r\nJessica Chastain as Murphy ""Murph"" Cooper, Joseph\'s daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist Mackenzie Foy as young Murph Ellen Burstyn as elderly Murph\r\nMackenzie Foy as young Murph\r\nEllen Burstyn as elderly Murph\r\nJohn Lithgow as Donald, Cooper\'s elderly father-in-law\r\nMichael Caine as Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper, and father of Amelia\r\nDavid Gyasi as Romilly, another high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member\r\nWes Bentley as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member\r\nCasey Affleck as Tom Cooper, Joseph\'s son, who eventually grows up to become a farmer Timothée Chalamet as young Tom\r\nTimothée Chalamet as young Tom\r\nMatt Damon as Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during the Lazarus program\r\nBill Irwin as TARS (voice and puppetry) and CASE (puppetry)\r\nJosh Stewart as CASE (voice)\r\nTopher Grace as Getty, Murph\'s colleague and love interest\r\nLeah Cairns as Lois, Tom\'s wife\r\nDavid Oyelowo as School Principal\r\nCollette Wolfe as Ms. Hanley\r\nWilliam Devane as Williams, another NASA member\r\nElyes Gabel as Administrator\r\nJeff Hephner as Doctor\r\nRuss Fega as Crew Chief\r\nProduction\r\nCrew\r\nChristopher Nolan – Director, producer, writer\r\nJonathan Nolan – Writer\r\nEmma Thomas – Producer\r\nLynda Obst – Producer\r\nHoyte van Hoytema – Cinematographer\r\nNathan Crowley – Production designer\r\nMary Zophres – Costume designer\r\nLee Smith – Editor\r\nHans Zimmer – Music composer\r\nPaul Franklin – Visual effects supervisor\r\nKip Thorne – Consultant, executive producer\r\nDevelopment and financing\r\nThe premise for Interstellar was conceived by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date. The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne\'s work, about ""the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,"" and attracted filmmaker Steven Spielberg\'s interest in directing. The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce. By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.\r\nAfter Spielberg moved his production studio DreamWorks from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012. Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story. In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar. Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight, and intended to merge his brother\'s screenplay with his own. By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions. The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross. To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.\r\nWarner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan\'s production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate ""A-list"" property. In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film\'s production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.\r\nWriting and casting\r\nScreenwriter Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years. To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology. Jonathan was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly commented: ""He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair."" His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne, picking what he felt, as director, he could get ""across to the audience and hopefully not lose them,"" before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own. Christopher kept in place Jonathan\'s conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s. He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead. After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted director Ken Burns and producer Dayton Duncan, requesting permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar, which was granted.\r\nChristopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom ""the audience could experience the story."" He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud, which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder. Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective. Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan\'s home, where she read the script for Interstellar. In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles. Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her. Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.\r\nPrincipal photography\r\nNolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan\'s cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014). More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan\'s previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle. Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand held for shooting interior scenes. Some of the film\'s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a Learjet.\r\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, ""The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy."" As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora\'s Letter, Flora being one of Nolan\'s four children with producer Emma Thomas.\r\nThe film\'s principal photography was scheduled to last four months. It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada. Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza. For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene, intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America. Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey\'s character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air. Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.\r\nShooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005). The location was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water. The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) to the country. They spent two weeks shooting there, during which a crew of approximately 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur. While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because the dry suit she was wearing had not been properly secured.\r\nAfter the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew moved to Los Angeles to shoot for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California. Principal photography concluded in December 2013. Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.\r\nProduction design\r\nInterstellar features three spacecraft—the Ranger, the Endurance, and the Lander. The Ranger\'s function is similar to the Space Shuttle\'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The Endurance, the crew\'s mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of twelve capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock. Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: ""It\'s a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It\'s really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose."" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to ""a heavy Russian helicopter.""\r\nThe film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. The director said: ""It has a very complicated design philosophy. It\'s based on mathematics. You\'ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it\'s all proportional."" Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor Josh Stewart\'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE. The human space habitats resemble O\'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O\'Neill in 1976.\r\nSound design and music\r\nGregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film\'s audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process. Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves. The studio\'s website stated that the film was ""mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel."" Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.\r\nComposer Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan\'s The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film\'s music but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score. Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.\r\nVisual effects\r\nThe visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar. According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan\'s The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens. Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.\r\nThe Ranger, Endurance, and Lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname ""maxatures"" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig. New Deal Studio\'s miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.\r\nInfluences\r\nThe director was influenced by what he called ""key touchstones"" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982), Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979). Andrei Tarkovsky\'s The Mirror (1975) influenced ""elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water"", according to Nolan, who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature. He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg\'s Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also ""as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum"". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production, following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts\' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors. Clark Kent\'s upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest. Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.\r\nScientific accuracy\r\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he ""worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein\'s general relativity equations."" Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: ""First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter."" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film. At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.\r\nAstrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire ""blight"" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere\'s oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds. Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that ""we don\'t really know what\'s in a black hole, so take it and run with it."" Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said Interstellar ""could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come."" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said ""Thorne\'s and Nolan\'s accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.""\r\nWormholes and black holes\r\nTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data. Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as ""anemic and at low temperature—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,"" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.\r\nChristopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product. Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.\r\nAs a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.\r\nAccording to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.\r\nMarketing\r\nThe teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey\'s character, Cooper. The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C. and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.\r\nChristopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote Interstellar. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\r\nIn October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms. The film\'s website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain, which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app. It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel. The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015. The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.\r\nParamount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from October 6 through November 19, 2014. The publisher Running Press released Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11. W. W. Norton & Company released The Science of Interstellar, a book by Thorne; Titan Books released the official novelization, written by Greg Keyes; and Wired magazine released a tie-in online comic, Absolute Zero, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy. The comic is a prequel to the film, with Mann as the protagonist.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nBefore Interstellar\'s public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at an IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry\'s filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22. On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild. The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film premiered on November 7 in Canada.\r\nInterstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America (United States and Canada) on November 5, with a wide release on November 7. The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the United Kingdom on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days. For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film\'s wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally. Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories. The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas, until surpassed by Universal Pictures\' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.\r\nInterstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures\' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format. According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format, which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers. McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as ""backward,"" as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.\r\nHome media\r\nInterstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States. It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks. It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent. It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.\r\nBox office\r\nInterstellar grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $489.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $677.4 million against a production budget of $165 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $47.2 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it twentieth on their list of 2014\'s ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"". It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.\r\nThe film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17.1 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is also the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release. It had a worldwide opening of $132.6 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014, and it became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales. Interstellar was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.37 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.36 million), Gravity (£6.24 million), and Inception (£5.91 million). The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total. Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $82.9 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets. It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater. It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million), Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million). Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan\'s biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises. It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share. It is Nolan\'s biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.\' biggest 2D opening, and the studio\'s third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014\'s The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million) and 2013\'s Pacific Rim ($45.2 million).\r\nIt topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) in its third weekend. Just 31 days after its release, the film became the 13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Korea with 9.1 million admissions trailing only Avatar (13.3 million admissions), and 2013\'s Frozen (10.3 million admissions). The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million. In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ($19 million). Interstellar and Big Hero 6 opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million. In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend. Interstellar had an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the 2014 US midterm elections. It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross. Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats. It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million. The film was widely released on November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead of Big Hero 6 ($15.8 million). On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition with Disney\'s Big Hero 6 ($56.2 million). IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross, while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross. In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behind old rival Big Hero 6 and newcomer Dumb and Dumber To (2014), and dropped 39% earning $29.1 million for a two-weekend total of $97.8 million. It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend. In its third week, the film earned $15.1 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomer The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and Big Hero 6.\r\nReception\r\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 371 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The website\'s critics consensus reads, ""Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nScott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is ""as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done"" and considered the film ""more personal"" than Nolan\'s previous films. Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the ""dull"" dialogue and ""tedious patches inside the space vessel."" David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for ""being so loud"" as to make some of the dialogue ""inaudible"". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film\'s scientific concepts. Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it ""a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour."" James Berardinelli called Interstellar ""an amazing achievement"" and ""simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking."" He named it the best film of 2014, and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a ""real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers"".\r\n""It\'s been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they\'re living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world. That\'s almost something you expect from Tarkovsky or Malick, not a science fiction adventure movie.\r\n—Quentin Tarantino on Interstellar.\r\nOliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times reported that ""film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times."" James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as ""brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science."" Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is ""a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike."" Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, ""This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen—in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can\'t measure in scientific terms. Love.""\r\nDescribing Nolan as a ""merchant of awe,"" Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was ""agonisingly"" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and ""deep-digging intelligence"" of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that."" In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its ""big-screen grandeur,"" while finding some of the dialogue ""clunky."" He described it further as ""an absurd endeavor"" and ""one of the most sublime movies of the decade."" Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film ""has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing,"" and ""thin characters"" despite seeing the film twice in order to ""give it a second chance."" He wrote that Interstellar ""ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of \'go into space to save the world\' movies."" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan\'s excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, "" is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan\'s work melted away ... At times, the movie\'s one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture, ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.""\r\nThe New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among ""science and faith and science and the humanities"" and ""illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms."" Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan\'s films are ""rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,"" and that ""although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see."" Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar ""the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick\'s 2001."" In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.\r\nAccolades\r\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, Interstellar received nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and won Best Visual Effects.', 'html': '<p>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.</p><p>Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</p><p>Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million with subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It received positive reviews for its acting, direction, screenplay, musical score, visual effects, ambition and themes. It has also received praise from many astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics.

Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 2067, ex-NASA pilot Cooper is forced to work as a farmer. He ignores his daughter, Murph, when she claims a ghost is communicating to her through her bookshelf, but later finds dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph\'s bedroom floor. He investigates, arriving at a secret NASA facility where Professor Brand explains that blight, dust storms and failing crops have rendered humanity incapable of surviving on Earth. NASA\'s current, secret mission involves engineering a way for humans to escape the Earth while finding another habitable planet. Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this possible, and asks Cooper to pilot the mission. Cooper agrees, promising a distraught Murph that he will return. He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft Endurance. The ship is headed towards a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn decades ago.</p><p>The Endurance passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua. The crew intends to investigate three planets, each previously explored by NASA volunteers, who shared positive reports for habitability. The first planet is an aqua planet with massive tidal waves and no dry land. Doyle drowns, and Amelia and Cooper fly back to the Endurance, only to find that decades have passed due to the time slippage caused by the planet\'s proximity to Gargantua. Romilly, having remained onboard, has aged twenty-three years. Cooper replays messages from Earth, learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand.</p><p>The crew journey to the second planet, where its previous investigator, Mann, falsified data to ensure a NASA mission to his planet so he could be rescued. Romilly is killed by Mann\'s booby-trap, and Mann attempts to hijack the Endurance but fails to dock properly, blowing out the hatch and killing himself in the process. Cooper and Amelia catch up with the damaged Endurance and dock safely. With limited resources available to use their engines, Cooper proposes a slingshot move around Gargantua, using its gravity to propel them toward the final planet. To shed weight, Cooper sacrifices himself at the last minute, dropping into the black hole and leaving Amelia to complete the journey.</p><p>Falling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract. He deduces that it was placed there by future humans with access to higher dimensions, as was the wormhole. He realizes that by using gravity, he is able to send messages to Murph and his past self. On Earth, Murph visits her childhood house after Professor Brand\'s death. She finds her father\'s old watch on her bookshelf, and notices the seconds-hand moving irregularly. She initially believes her ""ghost"" is back, only to realize that it was Cooper all along, sending her messages from a higher dimension. Cooper feeds Murph scientific data about the black hole\'s singularity, which she eventually uses to solve the gravity-equation, helping humanity escape the Earth.</p><p>His mission is now complete, and Cooper is ejected by future beings from the tesseract. He is sent back through the wormhole and picked up by a ranger orbiting Saturn. Due to the time slippage around Gargantua, almost ninety years have passed in Earth-time since Cooper left, though he has barely aged. He awakens on a space station and reunites with Murph, now a celebrated scientist who helped humans survive extinction. Nearing death, she advises Cooper not to wait around to see her die, and urges him to find Brand, who may have settled on the other planet that could become their new home. Cooper steals a spacecraft and sets off on his new journey. On the other planet, Amelia is building a new colony for future humans to inhabit. She removes her helmet and breathes the air, showing that the planet is capable of supporting life.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Matthew McConaughey as Joseph Cooper, a widowed NASA pilot who, after the agency was closed by the government, had become a farmer</li><li>Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, a NASA scientist, and astronaut</li><li>Jessica Chastain as Murphy ""Murph"" Cooper, Joseph\'s daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist Mackenzie Foy as young Murph Ellen Burstyn as elderly Murph</li><li>Mackenzie Foy as young Murph</li><li>Ellen Burstyn as elderly Murph</li><li>John Lithgow as Donald, Cooper\'s elderly father-in-law</li><li>Michael Caine as Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper, and father of Amelia</li><li>David Gyasi as Romilly, another high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member</li><li>Wes Bentley as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member</li><li>Casey Affleck as Tom Cooper, Joseph\'s son, who eventually grows up to become a farmer Timothée Chalamet as young Tom</li><li>Timothée Chalamet as young Tom</li><li>Matt Damon as Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during the Lazarus program</li><li>Bill Irwin as TARS (voice and puppetry) and CASE (puppetry)</li><li>Josh Stewart as CASE (voice)</li><li>Topher Grace as Getty, Murph\'s colleague and love interest</li><li>Leah Cairns as Lois, Tom\'s wife</li><li>David Oyelowo as School Principal</li><li>Collette Wolfe as Ms. Hanley</li><li>William Devane as Williams, another NASA member</li><li>Elyes Gabel as Administrator</li><li>Jeff Hephner as Doctor</li><li>Russ Fega as Crew Chief</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Crew</h4><ul><li>Christopher Nolan – Director, producer, writer</li><li>Jonathan Nolan – Writer</li><li>Emma Thomas – Producer</li><li>Lynda Obst – Producer</li><li>Hoyte van Hoytema – Cinematographer</li><li>Nathan Crowley – Production designer</li><li>Mary Zophres – Costume designer</li><li>Lee Smith – Editor</li><li>Hans Zimmer – Music composer</li><li>Paul Franklin – Visual effects supervisor</li><li>Kip Thorne – Consultant, executive producer</li></ul><h4>Development and financing</h4><p>The premise for Interstellar was conceived by producer Lynda Obst and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date. The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne\'s work, about ""the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans,"" and attracted filmmaker Steven Spielberg\'s interest in directing. The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce. By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.</p><p>After Spielberg moved his production studio DreamWorks from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012. Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story. In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar. Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight, and intended to merge his brother\'s screenplay with his own. By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions. The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross. To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.</p><p>Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan\'s production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate ""A-list"" property. In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film\'s production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.</p><h4>Writing and casting</h4><p>Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years. To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology. Jonathan was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly commented: ""He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair."" His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne, picking what he felt, as director, he could get ""across to the audience and hopefully not lose them,"" before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own. Christopher kept in place Jonathan\'s conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s. He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead. After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted director Ken Burns and producer Dayton Duncan, requesting permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar, which was granted.</p><p>Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom ""the audience could experience the story."" He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud, which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder. Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective. Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan\'s home, where she read the script for Interstellar. In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles. Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her. Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.</p><h4>Principal photography</h4><p>Nolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan\'s cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014). More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan\'s previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle. Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand held for shooting interior scenes. Some of the film\'s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a Learjet.</p><p>Nolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, ""The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy."" As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora\'s Letter, Flora being one of Nolan\'s four children with producer Emma Thomas.</p><p>The film\'s principal photography was scheduled to last four months. It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada. Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza. For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene, intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America. Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey\'s character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air. Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.</p><p>Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005). The location was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water. The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) to the country. They spent two weeks shooting there, during which a crew of approximately 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur. While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because the dry suit she was wearing had not been properly secured.</p><p>After the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew moved to Los Angeles to shoot for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California. Principal photography concluded in December 2013. Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.</p><h4>Production design</h4><p>Interstellar features three spacecraft—the Ranger, the Endurance, and the Lander. The Ranger\'s function is similar to the Space Shuttle\'s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The Endurance, the crew\'s mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of twelve capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock. Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: ""It\'s a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It\'s really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose."" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to ""a heavy Russian helicopter.""</p><p>The film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. The director said: ""It has a very complicated design philosophy. It\'s based on mathematics. You\'ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it\'s all proportional."" Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film, and actor Josh Stewart\'s voice replaced his voicing for CASE. The human space habitats resemble O\'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O\'Neill in 1976.</p><h4>Sound design and music</h4><p>Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film\'s audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process. Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves. The studio\'s website stated that the film was ""mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel."" Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.</p><p>Composer Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan\'s The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details for writing the film\'s music but instead gave the composer a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided that the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score. Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.</p><h4>Visual effects</h4><p>The visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar. According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan\'s The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens. Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.</p><p>The Ranger, Endurance, and Lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname ""maxatures"" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig. New Deal Studio\'s miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.</p><br/><h3>Influences</h3><p>The director was influenced by what he called ""key touchstones"" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982), Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979). Andrei Tarkovsky\'s The Mirror (1975) influenced ""elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water"", according to Nolan, who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature. He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg\'s Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also ""as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum"". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production, following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts\' visors. For further inspiration, the director invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors. Clark Kent\'s upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest. Apart from films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.</p><br/><h3>Scientific accuracy</h3><p>Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne stated that he ""worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein\'s general relativity equations."" Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: ""First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter."" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film. At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.</p><p>Astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire ""blight"" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere\'s oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds. Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that ""we don\'t really know what\'s in a black hole, so take it and run with it."" Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and has said Interstellar ""could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come."" Similarly, Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said ""Thorne\'s and Nolan\'s accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent.""</p><h4>Wormholes and black holes</h4><p>To create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data. Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as ""anemic and at low temperature—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,"" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.</p><p>Christopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product. Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.</p><p>As a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.</p><p>According to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><p>The teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey\'s character, Cooper. The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C. and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.</p><p>Christopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote Interstellar. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 Moon landing.</p><p>In October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms. The film\'s website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain, which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app. It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel. The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015. The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.</p><p>Paramount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from October 6 through November 19, 2014. The publisher Running Press released Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11. W. W. Norton & Company released The Science of Interstellar, a book by Thorne; Titan Books released the official novelization, written by Greg Keyes; and Wired magazine released a tie-in online comic, Absolute Zero, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy. The comic is a prequel to the film, with Mann as the protagonist.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Before Interstellar\'s public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at an IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry\'s filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22. On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild. The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film premiered on November 7 in Canada.</p><p>Interstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America (United States and Canada) on November 5, with a wide release on November 7. The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the United Kingdom on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days. For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film\'s wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally. Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories. The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas, until surpassed by Universal Pictures\' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.</p><p>Interstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures\' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format. According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format, which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers. McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as ""backward,"" as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Interstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States. It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks. It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent. It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.</p><h4>Box office</h4><p>Interstellar grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $489.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $677.4 million against a production budget of $165 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $47.2 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it twentieth on their list of 2014\'s ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"". It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.</p><p>The film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17.1 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is also the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release. It had a worldwide opening of $132.6 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014, and it became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales. Interstellar was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.37 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.36 million), Gravity (£6.24 million), and Inception (£5.91 million). The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total. Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $82.9 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets. It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater. It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million), Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million). Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan\'s biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises. It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share. It is Nolan\'s biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.\' biggest 2D opening, and the studio\'s third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014\'s The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million) and 2013\'s Pacific Rim ($45.2 million).</p><p>It topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) in its third weekend. Just 31 days after its release, the film became the 13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Korea with 9.1 million admissions trailing only Avatar (13.3 million admissions), and 2013\'s Frozen (10.3 million admissions). The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million. In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ($19 million). Interstellar and Big Hero 6 opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million. In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend. Interstellar had an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the 2014 US midterm elections. It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross. Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats. It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million. The film was widely released on November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead of Big Hero 6 ($15.8 million). On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition with Disney\'s Big Hero 6 ($56.2 million). IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross, while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross. In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behind old rival Big Hero 6 and newcomer Dumb and Dumber To (2014), and dropped 39% earning $29.1 million for a two-weekend total of $97.8 million. It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend. In its third week, the film earned $15.1 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomer The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and Big Hero 6.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 371 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The website\'s critics consensus reads, ""Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.</p><p>Scott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is ""as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done"" and considered the film ""more personal"" than Nolan\'s previous films. Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the ""dull"" dialogue and ""tedious patches inside the space vessel."" David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for ""being so loud"" as to make some of the dialogue ""inaudible"". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film\'s scientific concepts. Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it ""a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour."" James Berardinelli called Interstellar ""an amazing achievement"" and ""simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking."" He named it the best film of 2014, and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a ""real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers"".</p><blockquote>""It\'s been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they\'re living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world. That\'s almost something you expect from Tarkovsky or Malick, not a science fiction adventure movie.</blockquote><p>—Quentin Tarantino on Interstellar.</p><p>Oliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times reported that ""film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times."" James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as ""brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science."" Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is ""a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike."" Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, ""This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen—in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can\'t measure in scientific terms. Love.""</p><p>Describing Nolan as a ""merchant of awe,"" Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was ""agonisingly"" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and ""deep-digging intelligence"" of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that."" In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its ""big-screen grandeur,"" while finding some of the dialogue ""clunky."" He described it further as ""an absurd endeavor"" and ""one of the most sublime movies of the decade."" Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film ""has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing,"" and ""thin characters"" despite seeing the film twice in order to ""give it a second chance."" He wrote that Interstellar ""ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of \'go into space to save the world\' movies."" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan\'s excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, "" is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan\'s work melted away ... At times, the movie\'s one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture, ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.""</p><p>The New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among ""science and faith and science and the humanities"" and ""illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms."" Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan\'s films are ""rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,"" and that ""although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see."" Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar ""the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick\'s 2001."" In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>At the 87th Academy Awards, Interstellar received nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and won Best Visual Effects.</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt0816692', 'title': 'Interstellar', 'fullTitle': 'Interstellar

He is recruited by Terence Fletcher, the conductor and bandleader of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, to play in Fletcher\'s ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Andrew quickly discovers that Fletcher is relentlessly strict and ruthless to his students; he physically and verbally abuses Andrew after Andrew fails to keep the tempo during the ensemble\'s rehearsal of Hank Levy\'s ""Whiplash"".\r\nDetermined to impress Fletcher, Andrew practices until his hands begin to bleed. In a jazz competition, after their first set, Andrew misplaces Carl\'s sheet music. When called for their second set, Carl insists that he can\'t play without his sheet music, but Andrew retorts that he can perform the second set from memory. After a successful performance, Fletcher promotes Andrew to the core drummer for the Studio Band. Fletcher also enlists Ryan Connolly, the core drummer from a lower-level ensemble within the conservatory.\r\nAs a result of his single-mindedness and Fletch\'s teaching, Andrew\'s relationship with his family begins to deteriorate. After Fletcher promotes Connolly to core drummer, Andrew continues practicing to his limit, breaking up with his girlfriend Nicole in order to focus solely on drumming. After a grueling five-hour practice session with Tanner and Connolly in which Fletcher repeatedly lashes out at them, Andrew eventually earns back the core position.\r\nOn the way to the next competition, the bus Andrew is riding breaks down. He rents a car but arrives late and realizes he left his sticks at the rental office. Fletcher berates Andrew, and tells him that he has 10 minutes to get his sticks. Andrew races back and retrieves them, but is unable to focus on driving and his car is hit by a truck on the way back. Severely injured, Andrew crawls from the wreckage and runs back to the theater, arriving just as the ensemble enters stage. He struggles to play ""Caravan"" due to his injuries, and Fletcher halts the performance to dismiss him. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher on-stage, but is pulled away by security and expelled from Shaffer.\r\nAt his father\'s request, Andrew meets a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey, a former student of Fletcher, who committed suicide by hanging due to severe emotional distress caused by Fletcher\'s abuse. Casey\'s parents want Fletcher forbidden from teaching, and Andrew agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher.\r\nFollowing his expulsion, Andrew abandons drumming and begins working in a restaurant. He visits a jazz club and encounters Fletcher playing piano. Fletcher claims his methods were solely intended to motivate promising students, referencing the story of how Charlie Parker rose to fame.\r\nFletcher invites Andrew to perform with Fletcher\'s band at the JVC Jazz Festival, assuring Andrew that the songs will be the same ones played by the Studio Band; Andrew hesitantly accepts. Andrew calls Nicole and invites her to the performance, apologizing for the way he ended their relationship. She is noncommittal, having started a new relationship. Andrew arrives at JVC and the band goes onstage. Just before they begin their first piece, Fletcher reveals that he knows Andrew testified against him and got Fletcher fired from his position. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band with a song Andrew does not know, for which Andrew has not been given the sheet music.\r\nAfter attempting to perform, Andrew walks off stage humiliated, but returns and cuts off Fletcher\'s introduction to their next piece by playing ""Caravan"", cueing in the band himself. Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. Andrew plays his part perfectly and Fletcher begins to enjoy the piece as it goes on. As the piece finishes Andrew continues playing into an extended solo. Fletcher nods in approval of Andrew\'s performance before cueing the band finale.\r\nCast\r\nMiles Teller as Andrew Neiman, an ambitious young jazz drummer at Shaffer\r\nJ. K.

He based the conductor, Terence Fletcher, on his former band instructor (who died in 2003) but ""pushed it further"", adding elements of Buddy Rich and other band leaders known for their harsh treatment. Chazelle said he wrote the film ""initially in frustration"" while trying to get his musical La La Land off the ground.\r\nRight of Way Films and Blumhouse Productions helped Chazelle turn 15 pages of his original screenplay into a short film starring Johnny Simmons as Neiman and J. K. Simmons (no relation) as Fletcher. The 18-minute short film received acclaim after debuting at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, winning the short film Jury Award for fiction, which attracted investors to produce the complete version of the script. The feature-length film was financed for $3.3 million by Bold Films.\r\nIn August 2013, Miles Teller signed on to star in the role originated by Johnny Simmons; J. K. Simmons remained attached to his original role. Early on, Chazelle gave J. K. Simmons direction that ""I want you to take it past what you think the normal limit would be,"" telling him: ""I don\'t want to see a human being on-screen any more. I want to see a monster, a gargoyle, an animal."" Many of the band members were real musicians or music students, and Chazelle tried to capture their expressions of fear and anxiety when they were pressed by Simmons. Chazelle said that between takes, Simmons was ""as sweet as can be"", which he credits for keeping ""the shoot from being nightmarish"".\r\nPrincipal photography began in September 2013, with filming taking place throughout Los Angeles, including the Hotel Barclay, Palace Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre, with a few exterior shots filmed in New York City to create the setting. The film was shot in 17 days, with a schedule of 14 hours of filming per day. Chazelle was involved in a serious car accident in the third week of shooting and was hospitalized with possible concussion, but he returned to set the next day to finish the film on time.\r\nMusic\r\nThe soundtrack album was released on October 7, 2014, via Varèse Sarabande label. The soundtrack consists of 24 tracks divided in three different parts: original jazz pieces written for the film, original underscore parts written for the film, and classic jazz standards written by Stan Getz, Duke Ellington, and other musicians. The actual drummer was Bernie Dresel.\r\nOn March 27, 2020, an expanded deluxe edition was released on double CD and 2-LP gatefold sleeve vinyl with new cover art, and featured original music by Justin Hurwitz, plus bonus track and remixes by Timo Garcia, Opiuo, Murray A. Lightburn and more.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nIn North America, the film opened in a limited release on October 10, 2014, in 6 theaters, grossing $135,388 ($22,565 per theater) and finishing 34th at the box office. It expanded to 88 locations, then 419 locations.

Whiplash grossed $13.1 million in the U.S. and Canada and $35.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $49 million against a budget of $3.3 million.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 94% based on 303 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The site\'s critical consensus states, ""Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, Whiplash is a brilliant sophomore effort from director Damien Chazelle and a riveting vehicle for stars J. K. Simmons and Miles Teller."" On Metacritic the film has a score of 88 out of 100, based on reviews from 49 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim."" Simmons received wide praise for his performance and won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\r\nPeter Debruge, in his review for Variety, said that the film ""demolishes the cliches of the musical-prodigy genre, investing the traditionally polite stages and rehearsal studios of a topnotch conservatory with all the psychological intensity of a battlefield or sports arena."" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the performances of Teller and Simmons, writing: ""Teller, who greatly impressed in last year\'s Sundance entry The Spectacular Now, does so again in a performance that is more often simmering than volatile ...

Whiplash also won the 87th Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and the 87th Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\r\nAmber Wilkinson of The Daily Telegraph praised the direction and editing, writing: ""Chazelle\'s film has a sharp and gripping rhythm, with shots, beautifully edited by Tom Cross... often cutting to the crash of Andrew\'s drums."" James Rocchi of Indiewire gave a positive review and said, ""Whiplash is ... full of bravado and swagger, uncompromising where it needs to be, informed by great performances and patient with both its characters and the things that matter to them."" Henry Barnes of The Guardian gave the film a positive review, calling it a rare film ""about music that professes its love for the music and its characters equally.""\r\nForrest Wickman of Slate said the film distorted jazz history and promoted a misleading idea of genius, adding that ""In all likelihood, Fletcher isn’t making a Charlie Parker. He\'s making the kind of musician that would throw a cymbal at him."" In The New Yorker, Richard Brody said ""Whiplash honors neither jazz nor cinema."" Jazz bassist Adam Neely said the film presented an inaccurate depiction of modern music education, as well as the tastes, attitudes, and subculture of actual jazz musicians, while observing that the film treats music as a sport rather than an art form.\r\nTop ten lists\r\nThe film appeared on many critics’ end of year lists. Metacritic collected lists published by major film critics and publications, and in their analysis recorded that Whiplash appeared on 57 lists and in 1st place on 5 of those lists.

Neville\'s daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any survivors who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks reveal his wife, Zoe, and daughter, Marley, died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan as the military was enforcing a quarantine of the island. Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. Neville\'s only companion is his German Shepherd Samantha (Sam) and to cope with his loneliness, he regularly ""talks"" to some mannequins and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself with Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers.\r\nOne day as Neville hunts a deer, Sam pursues it into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and locates the deer\'s corpse along with Sam, but discovers the building is infested with Darkseekers. Both escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight. Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker. A male Darkseeker attempts to pursue them but is halted by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female seemingly without success.\r\nThe next day, Neville notices ""Fred"", a mannequin usually at the local video store, positioned outside Grand Central Terminal and shoots him in confusion. However, Neville realizes he is being watched by the Darkseekers from within nearby buildings. As he approaches Fred\'s body, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female and is rendered unconscious after hitting his head. By the time he wakes up the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam eliminate them, but Sam is bitten during the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death as she begins to turn. Heartbroken and driven by rage, Neville ventures out and deliberately attacks a group of Darkseekers the following night, before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, Anna and a young boy named Ethan, who have traveled from Maryland after hearing his broadcast.\r\nThey transport the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo, and are making their way to a survivors\' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville argues no such survivors\' camp exists. As he continues working to cure the female Darkseeker, Neville theorizes by lowering her body temperature with ice, he can increase the treatment\'s potency. The next night, a group of Darkseekers, who tracked Anna and Neville the night before, invade the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory sealing themselves in with the female test subject. Discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure.\r\nThe following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors\' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville\'s efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend.\r\nAlternate ending\r\nThe two-disc special edition DVD, released in 2008, contains an alternate ending which more closely follows the novel.\r\nDuring the lab attack, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker\'s neck and the alpha male is trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally break down upon his mate\'s return. Although the alpha male initially contemplates killing Neville, he forgives his former adversary and departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many photographs of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years.\r\nThe next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors\' colony. They cross the George Washington Bridge, while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: ""You are not alone.""\r\nCast\r\nWill Smith as Dr. Robert Neville: A former U.S. Army virologist before the worldwide plague, he loses his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan is quarantined, and spends the next three years trying to find a cure while defending himself against the Darkseekers. He is immune to the virus and uses vials of his blood to try to create a cure.\r\nAlice Braga as Anna Montez: A religious survivor from Brazil, she spent days harbored on a Red Cross ship in Baltimore. After the city was overrun, she stayed with Ethan and several other survivors on the ship, but eventually, only Ethan and she survived since they were immune and the others were either infected or killed. She followed Neville\'s broadcasts to track him.\r\nCharlie Tahan as Ethan: A boy from Baltimore, he spent time on the Red Cross ship with Anna and accompanied her when the ship was overrun.\r\nDash Mihok as Alpha Male, the dominant male of the vampiric mutant Darkseekers, he is determined to get his mate back from Neville, defying Neville\'s perception of them as mindless and emotionless creatures.\r\nEmma Thompson as Dr. Alice Krippin: The doctor who creates the cancer cure, she inadvertently brings mankind to the brink of extinction. Neville dubs the virus ""the Krippin virus"". Thompson\'s performance is uncredited.\r\nSalli Richardson as Zoe Neville, Robert\'s wife\r\nWillow Smith as Marley Neville, Robert\'s daughter (Willow is the real-life daughter of Will Smith.)\r\nJoanna Numata as Alpha Female, the Alpha Male\'s mate, she gets taken by Neville and is used as the subject for his cure.\r\nDarrell Foster as Mike\r\nPat Fraley as voice of the President of the United States\r\nMike Patton as voices of the Darkseekers\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nThe science-fiction horror genre reemerged in the late 1990s. In 1995, Warner Bros. began developing the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson\'s 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich\'s first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called \'Hemocytes\') were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer.\r\nActors Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film, using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director; however, by June 1997, the studio\'s preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations, with production slated to begin the coming September, using Houston as a stand-in for the film\'s setting of Los Angeles. Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, John Logan, with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott/Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending. The creatures in Logan\'s version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott – then on a negative streak of box office disappointments – and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an ""esoteric"" draft by writer Neal Jimenez, Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again.\r\nIn December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film\'s budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office failures of Scott\'s last three films, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger\'s recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio\'s latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.\r\nIn March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget. The project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn\'s dislike of the script. In 2004, Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film. In September 2005, director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project, with production slated to begin in 2006. Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Lawrence, whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, ""Something\'s always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long.""\r\nGoldsman took on the project, as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith\'s film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor\'s films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks; production was given a green light, using Goldsman\'s script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich\'s script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith\'s improvisational skills and Lawrence\'s preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion\'s film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.\r\nCasting\r\nWill Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like ""Gladiator Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. always felt like it had those possibilities to me."" The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that ""when you\'re on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict."" The film\'s dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, ""Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?"" He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks\' performance in Cast Away (2000).\r\nAbbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville\'s dog Sam. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert\'s wife, and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna. Willow Smith, Will Smith\'s daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville\'s daughter. Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her cure for cancer that mutates into the virus. Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected ""hemocytes"", and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected ""alpha male"". Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President\'s voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show.\r\nFilming\r\nAkiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, ""L.A. looks empty at three o\'clock in the afternoon, New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world."" Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.\r\nFilming began on September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville\'s home, while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, ""I don\'t think anyone\'s going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That\'s the most middle fingers I\'ve ever gotten in my career.""\r\nA bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York\'s citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film\'s reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members. Also present were several Humvees, three Strykers, a 110-foot (34 m) cutter, a 41-foot (12 m) utility boat, and two 25-foot (7.6 m) response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Filming concluded on March 31, 2007. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island.\r\nThe end of the film was shot in Lambertville, New Jersey.\r\nReshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, ""We weren\'t seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It\'s not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, \'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.\' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie.""\r\nEffects\r\nA week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as ""Darkseekers"" or ""hemocytes"" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time, and Lawrence explained:\r\n""They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can\'t get out of people in the middle of the night when they\'re barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they\'re constantly hyperventilating, which you can\'t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out.""— Francis Lawrence\r\nThe actors remained on set to provide motion capture. ""The film\'s producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard"", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.\r\nIn addition, CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence:\r\n""We didn\'t want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There\'s something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted.""— Francis Lawrence (2007)\r\nMusic\r\nThe soundtrack for I Am Legend was released on January 15, 2008, under the record label Varèse Sarabande. The music was composed by James Newton Howard. The film also features Bob Marley songs ""Redemption Song"" ""Three Little Birds"" and ""I Shot the Sheriff"".\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nI Am Legend was originally slated for a November 21, 2007, release in the United States and Canada, but was delayed to December 14. The film opened on December 26, 2007, in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, having been originally scheduled for January 4, 2008.\r\nIn December 2007, China temporarily suspended the release of all American films in the country, which is believed to have delayed the release of I Am Legend. Will Smith spoke to the chairman of China Film Group about securing a release date, later explaining, ""We struggled very, very hard to try to get it to work out, but there are only a certain amount of foreign films that are allowed in.""\r\nPremieres were held in Tokyo, New York, and London. At the London premiere in Leicester Square, British comedian and actor Neg Dupree was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting ""I am Negend!"". The stunt was part of his ""Neg\'s Urban Sports"" section of comedy game show Balls of Steel.\r\nMarketing\r\nThe film\'s teaser trailer was attached to the screenings of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. And a tie-in comic from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics was created, I Am Legend: Awakening. The project drew upon collaboration from Bill Sienkiewicz, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author Orson Scott Card. The son of the original book\'s author, Richard Christian Matheson, also collaborated on the project. The project advanced from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes (created by the team from Broken Saints) were shown on the official website.\r\nIn October 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures, in conjunction with the Electric Sheep Company, launched the online multiplayer game I Am Legend: Survival in the virtual world Second Life. The game was the largest launched in the virtual world in support of a film release, permitting people to play against each other as the infected or the uninfected across a replicated 60 acres (240,000 m2) of New York City. The studio also hired the ad agency Crew Creative to develop a website that was specifically viewable on the iPhone.\r\nHome media\r\nThe film was released on DVD on March 18, 2008, in two editions: a one-disc release, including the movie with four animated comics (""Death As a Gift"", ""Isolation"", ""Sacrificing the Few for the Many"", and ""Shelter""), and other DVD-ROM features, and a two-disc special edition that includes all these extras, an alternative theatrical version of the movie with an ending that follows closer to that from the novel, and a digital copy of the film. On the high-definition end, the movie has been released on the Blu-ray Disc format and HD DVD format along with the DVD release, with the HD-DVD version being released later on April 8, 2008. Both HD releases include all the features available in the two-disc DVD edition. A three-disk Ultimate Collector\'s Edition was also released on December 9, 2008.\r\nThe film has sold 7.04 million DVDs and earned $126.2 million in revenue, making it the sixth-best-selling DVD of 2008. However, Warner Bros. was reportedly ""a little disappointed"" with the film\'s performance on the DVD market.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 217 reviews with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith\'s mesmerizing performance."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nA. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a ""graceful and effortless performance"" and also noted the ""third-act collapse"". He felt that the movie ""does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization"". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that ""the Infected just aren\'t that scary."" NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film\'s subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in ""prime form"", also saying there are ""some amazing sequences"" and that there was ""a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film."" In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, ""Given its setup, I Am Legend is well-constructed to involve us with Dr. Neville and his campaign to survive."" The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson\'s novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film\'s third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release.\r\nOther response\r\nPopular Mechanics published an article on December 14, 2007, addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:\r\nThe magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, virologist W. Ian Lipkin, MD, and Michel Bruneau, PhD, comparing their predictions with the film\'s depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus\' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville\'s method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: ""This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely,"" Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says.\r\nMarxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek criticized the film politically for, in his view, ""being the most regressive adaptation from the novel."" He said that while the original novel had a ""progressive multicultural message"" where Neville became a ""legend"" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampire were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through ""divine intervention."" For Žižek, this misses the original message and ""openly opt for religious fundamentalism.""\r\nAccolades\r\nI Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards, and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards, and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards. In June 2008, Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Will Smith also won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Male Performance.\r\nSequel\r\nDirector Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director, contingent on a sufficiently interesting story. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of being alone. Lawrence stated, ""... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"" In May 2011, Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, ""I don\'t think that\'s ever going to happen.""\r\nIn 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had begun to produce another installment with the intention of having Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the author Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of the story, hoping to create a franchise with the new film. By 2014, Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, had not commented on whether he would appear.\r\nOn March 4, 2022, a sequel was officially announced as in development, with Will Smith reprising his role and Michael B. Jordan set to star, and both producing. Akiva Goldsman would also return to write the screenplay.\r\nBibliography\r\nI Am Legend, Richard Matheson, Tor Books; Reissue edition (October 30, 2007), ISBN 0-7653-1874-1', 'html': '<p>I Am Legend is a 2007 American post-apocalyptic action thriller film loosely based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson. Directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, the film stars Will Smith as US Army virologist Robert Neville. It is set in New York City after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants. Neville is immune to the virus, and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants. It is the third feature-film adaptation of Matheson\'s novel following 1964\'s The Last Man on Earth and 1971\'s The Omega Man.</p><p>Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994 and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene at the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><p>I Am Legend was released on December 14, 2007, in the United States and Canada. It opened to the largest-ever box office (not adjusted for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. in December and was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2007, earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally for a total of $585 million. The film received generally positive reviews, with Smith\'s performance being singled out for praise, while criticism focused on its divergences from the novel, particularly the ending. In 2022, a sequel was revealed to be in development, with Smith set to reprise his role as Neville and co-produce the film with Michael B. Jordan, who will also have a starring role.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>An attempt to genetically re-engineer the measles virus to cure cancer becomes lethal, infecting 99% of the world\'s population, turning those it does not kill into vampiric, albino, cannibalistic mutants called Darkseekers, who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and prey on the few who are left unaffected.</p><p>Three years after the outbreak, in 2012, U.S. Army virologist LTC Robert Neville lives an isolated life in a deserted Manhattan, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left. Neville\'s daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any survivors who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks reveal his wife, Zoe, and daughter, Marley, died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan as the military was enforcing a quarantine of the island. Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. Neville\'s only companion is his German Shepherd Samantha (Sam) and to cope with his loneliness, he regularly ""talks"" to some mannequins and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself with Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers.</p><p>One day as Neville hunts a deer, Sam pursues it into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and locates the deer\'s corpse along with Sam, but discovers the building is infested with Darkseekers. Both escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight. Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker. A male Darkseeker attempts to pursue them but is halted by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female seemingly without success.</p><p>The next day, Neville notices ""Fred"", a mannequin usually at the local video store, positioned outside Grand Central Terminal and shoots him in confusion. However, Neville realizes he is being watched by the Darkseekers from within nearby buildings. As he approaches Fred\'s body, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female and is rendered unconscious after hitting his head. By the time he wakes up the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam eliminate them, but Sam is bitten during the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death as she begins to turn. Heartbroken and driven by rage, Neville ventures out and deliberately attacks a group of Darkseekers the following night, before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, Anna and a young boy named Ethan, who have traveled from Maryland after hearing his broadcast.</p><p>They transport the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo, and are making their way to a survivors\' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville argues no such survivors\' camp exists. As he continues working to cure the female Darkseeker, Neville theorizes by lowering her body temperature with ice, he can increase the treatment\'s potency. The next night, a group of Darkseekers, who tracked Anna and Neville the night before, invade the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory sealing themselves in with the female test subject. Discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure.</p><p>The following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors\' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville\'s efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend.</p><h4>Alternate ending</h4><p>The two-disc special edition DVD, released in 2008, contains an alternate ending which more closely follows the novel.</p><p>During the lab attack, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker\'s neck and the alpha male is trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally break down upon his mate\'s return. Although the alpha male initially contemplates killing Neville, he forgives his former adversary and departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many photographs of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years.</p><p>The next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors\' colony. They cross the George Washington Bridge, while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: ""You are not alone.""</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville: A former U.S. Army virologist before the worldwide plague, he loses his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan is quarantined, and spends the next three years trying to find a cure while defending himself against the Darkseekers.

In 1995, Warner Bros. began developing the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson\'s 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich\'s first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called \'Hemocytes\') were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer.</p><p>Actors Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film, using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director; however, by June 1997, the studio\'s preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations, with production slated to begin the coming September, using Houston as a stand-in for the film\'s setting of Los Angeles. Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, John Logan, with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott/Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending. The creatures in Logan\'s version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott – then on a negative streak of box office disappointments – and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an ""esoteric"" draft by writer Neal Jimenez, Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again.</p><p>In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film\'s budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office failures of Scott\'s last three films, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger\'s recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio\'s latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.</p><p>In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget. The project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn\'s dislike of the script. In 2004, Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film. In September 2005, director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project, with production slated to begin in 2006. Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith, but turned it down to direct Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Lawrence, whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman, was fascinated by empty urban environments. He said, ""Something\'s always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long.""</p><p>Goldsman took on the project, as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith\'s film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor\'s films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks; production was given a green light, using Goldsman\'s script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich\'s script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith\'s improvisational skills and Lawrence\'s preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion\'s film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like ""Gladiator Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. always felt like it had those possibilities to me."" The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that ""when you\'re on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict."" The film\'s dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, ""Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?"" He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks\' performance in Cast Away (2000).</p><p>Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville\'s dog Sam. The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert\'s wife, and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna. Willow Smith, Will Smith\'s daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville\'s daughter. Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her cure for cancer that mutates into the virus. Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected ""hemocytes"", and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected ""alpha male"". Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President\'s voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, ""L.A. looks empty at three o\'clock in the afternoon, New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world."" Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.</p><p>Filming began on September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville\'s home, while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, ""I don\'t think anyone\'s going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That\'s the most middle fingers I\'ve ever gotten in my career.""</p><p>A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York\'s citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film\'s reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members. Also present were several Humvees, three Strykers, a 110-foot (34 m) cutter, a 41-foot (12 m) utility boat, and two 25-foot (7.6 m) response boat small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Filming concluded on March 31, 2007. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island.</p><p>The end of the film was shot in Lambertville, New Jersey.</p><p>Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, ""We weren\'t seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It\'s not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, \'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.\' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie.""</p><h4>Effects</h4><p>A week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as ""Darkseekers"" or ""hemocytes"" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time, and Lawrence explained:</p><blockquote>""They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can\'t get out of people in the middle of the night when they\'re barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they\'re constantly hyperventilating, which you can\'t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out.""— Francis Lawrence</blockquote><p>The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. ""The film\'s producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard"", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.</p><p>In addition, CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence:</p><blockquote>""We didn\'t want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There\'s something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted.""— Francis Lawrence (2007)</blockquote><br/><h3>Music</h3><table class=""table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100""><tbody><tr><th colspan=""2"" class=""infobox-above summary album"" style=""font-style: italic; background-color: gainsboro; font-size: 125%;"">I Am Legend</th></tr><tr><th colspan=""2"" class=""infobox-header description"" style=""background-color: gainsboro""><span>Film score</span> by <div class=""contributor"" style=""display:inline""><span>James Newton Howard</span></div></th></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" class=""infobox-label"">Released</th><td class=""infobox-data published"">January 15, 2008</td></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" class=""infobox-label"">Length</th><td class=""infobox-data""><span class=""duration""><span class=""min"">44</span>:<span class=""s"">00</span></span></td></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" class=""infobox-label""><span>Label</span></th><td class=""infobox-data hlist hlist-separated""><span>Varèse Sarabande</span></td></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" class=""infobox-label""><span>Producer</span></th><td class=""infobox-data hlist hlist-separated""><span>James Newton Howard</span></td></tr><tr><th colspan=""2"" class=""infobox-header description"" style=""background-color: gainsboro""><span>James Newton Howard</span> chronology</th></tr><tr><td colspan=""2"" class=""infobox-full-data""><table style=""background: transparent; width: 100%; min-width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; display: inline-table;""><tbody><tr style=""line-height: 1.4em;""><td style=""width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em .1em .2em 0""><i><span>The Water Horse</span></i></td><td style=""width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em .1em""><i><b>I Am Legend</b></i></td><td style=""width: 33%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; padding: .2em 0 .2em .1em""></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The soundtrack for I Am Legend was released on January 15, 2008, under the record label Varèse Sarabande.

The studio also hired the ad agency Crew Creative to develop a website that was specifically viewable on the iPhone.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>The film was released on DVD on March 18, 2008, in two editions: a one-disc release, including the movie with four animated comics (""Death As a Gift"", ""Isolation"", ""Sacrificing the Few for the Many"", and ""Shelter""), and other DVD-ROM features, and a two-disc special edition that includes all these extras, an alternative theatrical version of the movie with an ending that follows closer to that from the novel, and a digital copy of the film. On the high-definition end, the movie has been released on the Blu-ray Disc format and HD DVD format along with the DVD release, with the HD-DVD version being released later on April 8, 2008. Both HD releases include all the features available in the two-disc DVD edition. A three-disk Ultimate Collector\'s Edition was also released on December 9, 2008.</p><p>The film has sold 7.04 million DVDs and earned $126.2 million in revenue, making it the sixth-best-selling DVD of 2008. However, Warner Bros. was reportedly ""a little disappointed"" with the film\'s performance on the DVD market.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 217 reviews with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""I Am Legend overcomes questionable special effects and succeeds largely on the strength of Will Smith\'s mesmerizing performance."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale.</p><p>A. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a ""graceful and effortless performance"" and also noted the ""third-act collapse"". He felt that the movie ""does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization"". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that ""the Infected just aren\'t that scary."" NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film\'s subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in ""prime form"", also saying there are ""some amazing sequences"" and that there was ""a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film."" In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, ""Given its setup, I Am Legend is well-constructed to involve us with Dr. Neville and his campaign to survive."" The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson\'s novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film\'s third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release.</p><h4>Other response</h4><p>Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14, 2007, addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:</p><p>The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, virologist W. Ian Lipkin, MD, and Michel Bruneau, PhD, comparing their predictions with the film\'s depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus\' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville\'s method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: ""This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely,"" Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says.</p><p>Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek criticized the film politically for, in his view, ""being the most regressive adaptation from the novel."" He said that while the original novel had a ""progressive multicultural message"" where Neville became a ""legend"" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampire were legends to humans), the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through ""divine intervention."" For Žižek, this misses the original message and ""openly opt for religious fundamentalism.""</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>I Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards, and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards, and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards. In June 2008, Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Will Smith also won the MTV Movie Awards for Best Male Performance.</p><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director, contingent on a sufficiently interesting story. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of being alone. Lawrence stated, ""... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"" In May 2011, Lawrence stated that the prequel was no longer in development saying, ""I don\'t think that\'s ever going to happen.""</p><p>In 2012, Warner Bros. announced that negotiations had begun to produce another installment with the intention of having Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the author Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of the story, hoping to create a franchise with the new film. By 2014, Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, had not commented on whether he would appear.</p><p>On March 4, 2022, a sequel was officially announced as in development, with Will Smith reprising his role and Michael B. Jordan set to star, and both producing. Akiva Goldsman would also return to write the screenplay.</p><br/><h3>Bibliography</h3><ul><li>I Am Legend, Richard Matheson, Tor Books; Reissue edition (October 30, 2007), ISBN

It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.\r\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993.

In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1947, Portland, Maine banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Prison. He is befriended by Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate and prison contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\r\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\'s decrepit library.\r\nBrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red, that hope is what gets him through his time. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".\r\nTommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but Norton refuses to listen, and when Andy mentions the money laundering, Norton sends him back to solitary confinement. Norton has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\'s protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red—once he is released—to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\'s well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\r\nAt the next day\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 (equivalent to $3.09 million in 2021) of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\r\nThe following year, Red is finally paroled after serving 40 years. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach in Zihuatanejo, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.\r\nCast\r\nTim Robbins as Andy Dufresne:A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover\r\nMorgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding:A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy\r\nBob Gunton as Samuel Norton: The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary\r\nWilliam Sadler as Heywood: A member of Red\'s gang of long-serving convicts\r\nClancy Brown as Byron Hadley: The brutal captain of the prison guards\r\nGil Bellows as Tommy Williams: A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965\r\nJames Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen: The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned since the early 1900s\r\nThe cast also includes Mark Rolston as Bogs Diamond, the head of ""the Sisters"" gang and a prison rapist; Jeffrey DeMunn as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne\'s trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con; Ned Bellamy and Don McManus as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig. Renee Blaine portrays Andy\'s wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin. Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy\'s fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley, and Bill Bolender plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted. James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe film has been interpreted as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the ""lords of all creation"" invoking Jesus\' blessing. Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.\r\nEarly in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, ""I am the light of the world"", declaring himself Andy\'s savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President Richard Nixon. Norton\'s appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon\'s. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.\r\nZihuatanejo has been interpreted as an analogue for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means ""peace"". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife\'s death. Similarly, Red\'s freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red\'s story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic Mark Kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy\'s aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Film critic Roger Ebert argued that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one\'s feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy\'s integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.\r\nRobbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever ""jail"" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red\'s belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.\r\nMany elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.\r\nAndy and Red\'s relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men, that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red\'s true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nDarabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983 on the short film adaptation of ""The Woman in the Room"", buying the rights from him for $1—a Dollar Deal that King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page novella from King\'s 1982 collection Different Seasons, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was ""obvious"". King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: ""In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.""\r\nFive years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King\'s story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King\'s story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened The Shawshank Redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited Goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) directed by John Frankenheimer. While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project Against the Wall. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.\r\nAt the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont\'s script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King\'s 1982 novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.\r\nCastle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, ""you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do"". Reiner served as Darabont\'s mentor on the project, instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.\r\nCasting\r\nFreeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella\'s character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed ""Red"". Freeman\'s character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying ""Maybe it\'s because I\'m Irish."" Freeman opted not to research his role, saying ""acting the part of someone who\'s incarcerated doesn\'t require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don\'t change. Once you\'re in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe."" Darabont was already aware of Freeman from his minor role in another prison drama, Brubaker (1980), while Robbins had been excited to work alongside the actor, having grown up watching him in The Electric Company children\'s television show.\r\nDarabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such as Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall, for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role—Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob\'s Ladder. When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.\r\nCast initially as young convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following his success in Thelma & Louise, and the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows. James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film\'s early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins\', allowing Andy to believably use the warden\'s suit.\r\nPortraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production\'s liaison officer, but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Freeman\'s son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting ""fresh fish"" as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The novella\'s original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.\r\nFilming\r\nOn a $25 million budget, principal photography took place over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, ""Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those."" Freeman referred to Darabont\'s requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film, and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, ""A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs."" He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.\r\nMarvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.\r\nThe 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden\'s office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a sound stage built inside a nearby shuttered Westinghouse Electric factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates\' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the Westinghouse factory, except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch\'s admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison\'s more confined cells. Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.\r\nJust as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red\'s reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of Saint Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at \'Zihuatanejo\' is the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area for leatherback sea turtles. Scenes shot in Upper Sandusky included the prison wood shop scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear The Marriage of Figaro (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the Wyandot County Courthouse. Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin in Malabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, Butler, Ohio, stood in for Buxton, Maine, and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.\r\nFor the scene depicting Andy\'s escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock. While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a ""river of shit"", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. Of the scene, Robbins said, ""when you\'re doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don\'t want to be the one gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety."" The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy\'s escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water. Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he ""over-lit"" it. In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins\' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins\' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.\r\nAs for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins\' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder\'s The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemption\'s domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda. As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors\' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters. Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film\'s production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.\r\nPost-production\r\nThe final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont\'s former agent, who died during filming from AIDS. The film\'s first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered ""long"", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy\'s escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action. The film originally had a cold open that played out Andy\'s crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more ""punchy"" opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying ""I am terrified, there is no way home."" Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.\r\nIn Darabont\'s original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a ""commercial, sappy"" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision. The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a ""golly-gee-ain\'t-we-cute"" quality and excised it. The beach reunion was test audiences\' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: ""I think it\'s a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...""\r\nMusic\r\nThe film\'s score was composed by Thomas Newman. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, ""Shawshank Redemption"", plays during Andy\'s escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a ""triumphal flourish"" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. ""So Was Red"", played following Red\'s release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy\'s cache, became one of Newman\'s favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan ""casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take"", and this is heard in the finished film. Newman\'s score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nLeading up to its release, the film was test screened with the public. These were described as ""through the roof"", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King\'s name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a ""more prestigious audience"", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works such as The Shining and Cujo.\r\nFollowing early September premieres at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The Shawshank Redemption closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors\' cuts.\r\nThe film was also competing with Pulp Fiction ($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following its Palme d\'Or award win, and Forrest Gump ($330 million), which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of The Shawshank Redemption. Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: ""What was that Shinkshonk Reduction thing?"". Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of prison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.\r\nAfter being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12 million. In total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossing R-rated film of 1994.\r\nPost-theatrical\r\nDespite its disappointing box-office returns, in what was then considered a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on to become one of the top rented films of the year. It was the seventh top video rental of 1995 in the United States. Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well received by both male and female audiences, were considered key to the film\'s rental success.\r\nTed Turner\'s Turner Broadcasting System had acquired Castle Rock in 1993, which enabled his television channel, TNT, to obtain the cable-broadcast rights to the film. According to Glotzer, because of the low box-office numbers, TNT could air the film at a very low cost, but still charge premium advertising rates. The film began airing regularly on the network in June 1997. Television airings of the film accrued record-breaking numbers, and its repeated broadcast was considered essential to turning the film into a cultural phenomenon after its poor box-office performance. Darabont felt the turning point for the film\'s success was the Academy Award nominations, saying ""nobody had heard of the movie, and that year on the Oscar broadcast, they were mentioning this movie seven times"". In 1996, the rights to The Shawshank Redemption were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures, following the merger of its parent company Time Warner with the Turner Broadcasting System.\r\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 1.11 million viewers on the subscription television channel Film4 in 2006, making it the year\'s second most-watched film on subscription digital television.\r\nBy 2013, The Shawshank Redemption had aired on 15 basic cable networks, and in that year occupied 151 hours of airtime, rivaling Scarface (1983), and behind only Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). It was in the top 15% of movies among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 on the Spike, Up, Sundance TV, and Lifetime channels. Despite its mainly male cast, it was the most-watched movie on the female-targeted OWN network. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal article, based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, The Shawshank Redemption had made an estimated $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million. While finances for licensing the film for television are unknown, in 2014, current and former Warner Bros. executives confirmed that it was one of the highest-valued assets in the studio\'s $1.5 billion library. That same year, Gunton said that by its tenth anniversary in 2004, he was still earning six-figure residual payments, and was still earning a ""substantial income"" from it, which was considered unusual so many years after its release.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption opened to generally positive reviews. Some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nEntertainment Weekly\'s Owen Gleiberman said that Freeman makes the Red character feel genuine and ""lived-in"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said that Freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that Red\'s role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing Andy. She considered Freeman\'s commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. Maslin said that Freeman\'s performance was especially moving when describing how dependent Red had become on living within the prison walls. Variety\'s Leonard Klady suggested that Freeman had the ""showier"" role, allowing him ""a grace and dignity that came naturally"", without ever becoming banal, and The Washington Post\'s Desson Howe called Freeman a ""master"" of comedic and poignant cadence. Even Kenneth Turan\'s Los Angeles Times review, which Glotzer credited with derailing the film\'s box-office success, praised Freeman, saying his ""effortless screen presence lends Shawshank the closest thing to credibility it can manage"".\r\nOf Robbins\' performance, Gleiberman said that in his ""laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, is unable to make Andy connect with the audience"". Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and Klady stated that his ""riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless"" performance anchors the film. Howe said that while the character is ""cheesily messianic"" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to ""Forrest Gump goes to jail"", Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. The Hollywood Reporter stated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and Rolling Stone\'s Peter Travers said that the pair created something ""undeniably powerful and moving"". Gunton and Brown were deemed by Klady as ""extremely credible in their villainy"", while Howe countered that Gunton\'s warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.\r\nMaslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, while Klady said the only failings came when Darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. The Hollywood Reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film\'s long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film\'s mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners\' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a ""bunch of swell and softhearted guys"" to cast the prison experience in a ""rosy glow"". Klady summarized the film as ""estimable and haunting entertainment"", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy and Red\'s reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works because it is not about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.\r\nDeakins\' cinematography was routinely praised, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it ""foreboding"" and ""well-crafted"", and Travers saying ""the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates"". Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing ""the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls"". The Hollywood Reporter said of Newman\'s score, ""at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film\'s central theme"", and Klady described it as ""the right balance between the somber and the absurd"".\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1995, the most for a Stephen King film adaptation: Best Picture (Marvin), Best Actor (Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay (Darabont), Best Cinematography (Deakins), Best Film Editing (Richard Francis-Bruce), Best Sound (Robert J. Litt, Elliot Tyson, Michael Herbick, and Willie D. Burton), and Best Original Score (Newman, his first Academy Award nomination). It did not win in any category. It received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for Freeman, and Best Screenplay for Darabont.\r\nRobbins and Freeman were both nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the inaugural Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1995. Darabont was nominated for a Directors Guild of America award in 1994 for Best Director of a feature film, and a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Deakins won the American Society of Cinematographers award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography, while producer Niki Marvin was nominated for a 1994 Golden Laurel Award by the Producers Guild of America.\r\nLegacy\r\nDarabont later adapted and directed two other King stories, The Green Mile (1999) and The Mist (2007). In a 2016 interview, King said that The Shawshank Redemption was his favorite adaptation of his work, alongside Stand by Me.\r\nThe oak tree, under which Andy leaves a note for Red directing him to Zihuatanejo, became a symbol of hope for its role in the film, and is considered iconic. In 2016, The New York Times reported that the tree attracted thousands of visitors annually. The tree was partially destroyed on July 29, 2011, when it was split by lightning, and news of the damage was reported by U.S. and international publications. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016, and its vestiges were cut down in April 2017. The remains were turned into The Shawshank Redemption memorabilia including rock hammers and magnets.\r\nThe prison site, which was planned to be fully torn down after filming, became a tourist attraction. The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, a group of enthusiasts of the film, purchased the building and site from Ohio for one dollar in 2000 and took up maintaining it as a historical landmark, both as its purpose as a prison and as the filming site. A 2019 report estimated the attraction to be earning $16 million in annual revenue. Many of the rooms and props remain there, including the false pipe through which Andy escapes, and a portion of the oak tree from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011. The surrounding area is also visited by fans, while local businesses market ""Shawshanwiches"" and Bundt cakes in the shape of the prison. According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield), tourism in the area had increased every year since The Shawshank Redemption premiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy. As of 2019, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St Croix. The trail earned $16.9 million in revenue in 2018.\r\nIn late August 2014, a series of events was held in Mansfield to celebrate the film\'s 20th anniversary including a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, a bus tour of certain filming locations, and a cocktail party at the reformatory. Cast from the film attended some of the events, including Gunton, Scott Mann, Renee Blaine, and James Kisicki. The 25th anniversary was similarly celebrated in August 2019. Guests included Darabont, Blaine, Mann, Gunton, Alfonso Freeman, Bellows, Rolston, Claire Slemmer, and Frank Medrano. Darabont stated that only at this event, the first time he had returned to Mansfield, was he able to realize the lasting impact of the film, stating, ""It is a very surreal feeling to be back all these years later and people are still talking about it.""\r\nCritical reassessment\r\nContemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 91% approval rating from 81 critics, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The consensus reads, ""The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances."" The film also has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 21 critics indicating ""universal acclaim"".\r\nIn 1999, film critic Roger Ebert listed Shawshank on his list of The Great Movies. The film has been nominated for, or appeared on, the American Film Institute\'s lists celebrating the top 100 film or film-related topics. In 1998, it was nominated for AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movies list, and was number 72 on the 2007 revised list, outranking Forrest Gump (76) and Pulp Fiction (94). It was also number 23 on AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Cheers (2006) list charting inspiring films. The characters of Andy and Warden Norton received nominations for AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains list; AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list for ""Get busy livin\', or get busy dyin\'""; AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Songs list for ""Sull\'aria ... che soave zeffiretto"" (from The Marriage of Figaro); and AFI\'s 100 Years of Film Scores for Newman\'s work.\r\nIn 2005, the Writers Guild of America listed Darabont\'s screenplay at number 22 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays, and in 2006, Film4 listed it number 13 on its list of 50 Films to See Before You Die. In 2014, The Shawshank Redemption was named Hollywood\'s fourth-favorite film, based on a survey of 2,120 Hollywood-based entertainment industry members; entertainment lawyers skewed the most towards the film. In 2017, The Daily Telegraph named it the 17th-best prison film ever made, and USA Today listed it as one of the 50 best films of all time. In 2019, GamesRadar+ listed its ending as one of the best of all time.\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption appeared on several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s, by outlets including: Paste and NME (2012), Complex (2013), CHUD.com (2014), MSN (2015), TheWrap, Maxim, and Rolling Stone (all 2017).\r\nCultural impact\r\nIn November 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrated the film\'s 20th anniversary with a special one-night screening at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California. In 2015, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Darabont responded: ""I can think of no greater honor than for The Shawshank Redemption to be considered part of our country\'s cinematic legacy."" Variety said that the word ""Shawshank"" could be used to instantly convey images of a prison.\r\nThe significant and enduring public appreciation for the film has often been difficult for critics to define. In an interview, Freeman said, ""About everywhere you go, people say, \'The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw\'"" and that such praise ""Just comes out of them"". Robbins said, ""I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, \'That movie changed my life\' "". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, ""If that isn\'t the best, it\'s one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers\' minds, it\'s probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it."" In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was ""a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe"". Speaking on the film\'s 25th anniversary, Darabont said that older generations were sharing it with younger generations, contributing to its longevity.\r\nIt has been the number-one film on IMDb\'s user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather, having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s. In the United Kingdom, readers of Empire voted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four on Empire\'s 2008 list of ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"" and their 2017 list of ""The 100 Greatest Movies"". In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their favorite film of all time. It regularly appears on Empire\'s top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll by Sky UK (it lost to Forrest Gump), and ranked as Britain\'s favorite film in a 2015 YouGov poll. When the British Film Institute analyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted that The Shawshank Redemption was not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlike Pulp Fiction which fared better with younger voters, and Gone with the Wind (1939) with older voters.\r\nA 2017 poll conducted by Gatwick Airport also identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight. When film critic Mark Kermode interviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a ""religious experience"". It was also voted as New Zealand\'s favorite film in a 2015 poll. Lasting fan appreciation has led to it being considered one of the most beloved films of all time.', 'html': '<p>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.</p><p>Darabont purchased the film rights to King\'s story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film\'s score.</p><p>While The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film\'s box-office gross to $73.3 million.</p><p>Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most ""beloved"" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1947, Portland, Maine banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Prison. He is befriended by Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate and prison contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.</p><p>In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison\'s decrepit library.</p><p>Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red, that hope is what gets him through his time. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".</p><p>Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (GED) exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but Norton refuses to listen, and when Andy mentions the money laundering, Norton sends him back to solitary confinement. Norton has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy\'s protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red—once he is released—to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy\'s well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.</p><p>At the next day\'s roll call, the guards find Andy\'s cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton\'s suit, shoes, and ledger, containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 (equivalent to $3.09 million in 2021) of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.</p><p>The following year, Red is finally paroled after serving 40 years. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach in Zihuatanejo, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne:A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover</li><li>Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding:A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy</li><li>Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton: The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary</li><li>William Sadler as Heywood: A member of Red\'s gang of long-serving convicts</li><li>Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley: The brutal captain of the prison guards</li><li>Gil Bellows as Tommy Williams: A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965</li><li>James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen: The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned since the early 1900s</li></ul><p>The cast also includes Mark Rolston as Bogs Diamond, the head of ""the Sisters"" gang and a prison rapist; Jeffrey DeMunn as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne\'s trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con; Ned Bellamy and Don McManus as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig. Renee Blaine portrays Andy\'s wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin. Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy\'s fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley, and Bill Bolender plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted. James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.</p><br/><h3>Analysis</h3><p>The film has been interpreted as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the ""lords of all creation"" invoking Jesus\' blessing. Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.</p><p>Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, ""I am the light of the world"", declaring himself Andy\'s savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President Richard Nixon. Norton\'s appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon\'s. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.</p><p>Zihuatanejo has been interpreted as an analogue for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means ""peace"". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife\'s death. Similarly, Red\'s freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red\'s story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic Mark Kermode wrote that it can also be interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy\'s aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Film critic Roger Ebert argued that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one\'s feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy\'s integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.</p><p>Robbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever ""jail"" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red\'s belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.</p><p>Many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.</p><p>Andy and Red\'s relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men, that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red\'s true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>Darabont first collaborated with author Stephen King in 1983 on the short film adaptation of ""The Woman in the Room"", buying the rights from him for $1—a Dollar Deal that King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page novella from King\'s 1982 collection Different Seasons, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was ""obvious"". King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: ""In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.""</p><p>Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King\'s story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King\'s story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and It\'s a Wonderful Life (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened The Shawshank Redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited Goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) directed by John Frankenheimer. While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project Against the Wall. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.</p><p>At the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont\'s script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King\'s 1982 novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.</p><p>Castle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, ""you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do"". Reiner served as Darabont\'s mentor on the project, instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella\'s character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed ""Red"". Freeman\'s character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying ""Maybe it\'s because I\'m Irish."" Freeman opted not to research his role, saying ""acting the part of someone who\'s incarcerated doesn\'t require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don\'t change. Once you\'re in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe."" Darabont was already aware of Freeman from his minor role in another prison drama, Brubaker (1980), while Robbins had been excited to work alongside the actor, having grown up watching him in The Electric Company children\'s television show.</p><p>Darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such as Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall, for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role—Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob\'s Ladder. When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.</p><p>Cast initially as young convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following his success in Thelma & Louise, and the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows. James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film\'s early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins\', allowing Andy to believably use the warden\'s suit.</p><p>Portraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production\'s liaison officer, but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Freeman\'s son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting ""fresh fish"" as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The novella\'s original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>On a $25 million budget, principal photography took place over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, ""Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those."" Freeman referred to Darabont\'s requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film, and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, ""A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs."" He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.</p><p>Marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.</p><p>The 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden\'s office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a sound stage built inside a nearby shuttered Westinghouse Electric factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates\' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built set housed in the Westinghouse factory, except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch\'s admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison\'s more confined cells. Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.</p><p>Just as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red\'s reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of Saint Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at \'Zihuatanejo\' is the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area for leatherback sea turtles. Scenes shot in Upper Sandusky included the prison wood shop scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear The Marriage of Figaro (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the Wyandot County Courthouse. Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin in Malabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, Butler, Ohio, stood in for Buxton, Maine, and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.</p><p>For the scene depicting Andy\'s escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock. While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a ""river of shit"", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used chlorination to partially decontaminate it. Of the scene, Robbins said, ""when you\'re doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don\'t want to be the one gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety."" The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy\'s escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water. Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he ""over-lit"" it. In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins\' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins\' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.</p><p>As for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins\' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder\'s The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemption\'s domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda. As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors\' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters. Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film\'s production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>The final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont\'s former agent, who died during filming from AIDS. The film\'s first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered ""long"", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy\'s escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action. The film originally had a cold open that played out Andy\'s crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more ""punchy"" opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying ""I am terrified, there is no way home."" Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.</p><p>In Darabont\'s original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a ""commercial, sappy"" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision. The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a ""golly-gee-ain\'t-we-cute"" quality and excised it. The beach reunion was test audiences\' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: ""I think it\'s a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...""</p><h4>Music</h4><p>The film\'s score was composed by Thomas Newman. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, ""Shawshank Redemption"", plays during Andy\'s escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a ""triumphal flourish"" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. ""So Was Red"", played following Red\'s release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy\'s cache, became one of Newman\'s favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan ""casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take"", and this is heard in the finished film. Newman\'s score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Leading up to its release, the film was test screened with the public. These were described as ""through the roof"", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King\'s name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a ""more prestigious audience"", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for pulp fiction works such as The Shining and Cujo.</p><p>Following early September premieres at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The Shawshank Redemption closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors\' cuts.</p><p>The film was also competing with Pulp Fiction ($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following its Palme d\'Or award win, and Forrest Gump ($330 million), which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was also considered to work against the commercial success of The Shawshank Redemption. Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: ""What was that Shinkshonk Reduction thing?"". Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of prison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.</p><p>After being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12 million. In total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossing R-rated film of 1994.</p><h4>Post-theatrical</h4><p>Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in what was then considered a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on to become one of the top rented films of the year. It was the seventh top video rental of 1995 in the United States. Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well received by both male and female audiences, were considered key to the film\'s rental success.</p><p>Ted Turner\'s Turner Broadcasting System had acquired Castle Rock in 1993, which enabled his television channel, TNT, to obtain the cable-broadcast rights to the film. According to Glotzer, because of the low box-office numbers, TNT could air the film at a very low cost, but still charge premium advertising rates. The film began airing regularly on the network in June 1997. Television airings of the film accrued record-breaking numbers, and its repeated broadcast was considered essential to turning the film into a cultural phenomenon after its poor box-office performance. Darabont felt the turning point for the film\'s success was the Academy Award nominations, saying ""nobody had heard of the movie, and that year on the Oscar broadcast, they were mentioning this movie seven times"". In 1996, the rights to The Shawshank Redemption were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures, following the merger of its parent company Time Warner with the Turner Broadcasting System.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 1.11 million viewers on the subscription television channel Film4 in 2006, making it the year\'s second most-watched film on subscription digital television.</p><p>By 2013, The Shawshank Redemption had aired on 15 basic cable networks, and in that year occupied 151 hours of airtime, rivaling Scarface (1983), and behind only Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). It was in the top 15% of movies among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 on the Spike, Up, Sundance TV, and Lifetime channels. Despite its mainly male cast, it was the most-watched movie on the female-targeted OWN network. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal article, based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, The Shawshank Redemption had made an estimated $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million. While finances for licensing the film for television are unknown, in 2014, current and former Warner Bros. executives confirmed that it was one of the highest-valued assets in the studio\'s $1.5 billion library. That same year, Gunton said that by its tenth anniversary in 2004, he was still earning six-figure residual payments, and was still earning a ""substantial income"" from it, which was considered unusual so many years after its release.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The Shawshank Redemption opened to generally positive reviews. Some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including: Birdman of Alcatraz, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, Cool Hand Luke, and Riot in Cell Block 11. Gene Siskel said that like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, The Shawshank Redemption is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.</p><p>Entertainment Weekly\'s Owen Gleiberman said that Freeman makes the Red character feel genuine and ""lived-in"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times said that Freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that Red\'s role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing Andy. She considered Freeman\'s commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. Maslin said that Freeman\'s performance was especially moving when describing how dependent Red had become on living within the prison walls. Variety\'s Leonard Klady suggested that Freeman had the ""showier"" role, allowing him ""a grace and dignity that came naturally"", without ever becoming banal, and The Washington Post\'s Desson Howe called Freeman a ""master"" of comedic and poignant cadence. Even Kenneth Turan\'s Los Angeles Times review, which Glotzer credited with derailing the film\'s box-office success, praised Freeman, saying his ""effortless screen presence lends Shawshank the closest thing to credibility it can manage"".</p><p>Of Robbins\' performance, Gleiberman said that in his ""laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, is unable to make Andy connect with the audience"". Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and Klady stated that his ""riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless"" performance anchors the film. Howe said that while the character is ""cheesily messianic"" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to ""Forrest Gump goes to jail"", Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. The Hollywood Reporter stated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and Rolling Stone\'s Peter Travers said that the pair created something ""undeniably powerful and moving"". Gunton and Brown were deemed by Klady as ""extremely credible in their villainy"", while Howe countered that Gunton\'s warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.</p><p>Maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, while Klady said the only failings came when Darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. The Hollywood Reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film\'s long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film\'s mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners\' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a ""bunch of swell and softhearted guys"" to cast the prison experience in a ""rosy glow"". Klady summarized the film as ""estimable and haunting entertainment"", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy and Red\'s reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works because it is not about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.</p><p>Deakins\' cinematography was routinely praised, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it ""foreboding"" and ""well-crafted"", and Travers saying ""the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates"". Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing ""the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls"". The Hollywood Reporter said of Newman\'s score, ""at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film\'s central theme"", and Klady described it as ""the right balance between the somber and the absurd"".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1995, the most for a Stephen King film adaptation: Best Picture (Marvin), Best Actor (Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay (Darabont), Best Cinematography (Deakins), Best Film Editing (Richard Francis-Bruce), Best Sound (Robert J. Litt, Elliot Tyson, Michael Herbick, and Willie D. Burton), and Best Original Score (Newman, his first Academy Award nomination). It did not win in any category. It received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for Freeman, and Best Screenplay for Darabont.</p><p>Robbins and Freeman were both nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role at the inaugural Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1995. Darabont was nominated for a Directors Guild of America award in 1994 for Best Director of a feature film, and a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Deakins won the American Society of Cinematographers award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography, while producer Niki Marvin was nominated for a 1994 Golden Laurel Award by the Producers Guild of America.</p><br/><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Darabont later adapted and directed two other King stories, The Green Mile (1999) and The Mist (2007). In a 2016 interview, King said that The Shawshank Redemption was his favorite adaptation of his work, alongside Stand by Me.</p><p>The oak tree, under which Andy leaves a note for Red directing him to Zihuatanejo, became a symbol of hope for its role in the film, and is considered iconic. In 2016, The New York Times reported that the tree attracted thousands of visitors annually. The tree was partially destroyed on July 29, 2011, when it was split by lightning, and news of the damage was reported by U.S. and international publications. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016, and its vestiges were cut down in April 2017. The remains were turned into The Shawshank Redemption memorabilia including rock hammers and magnets.</p><p>The prison site, which was planned to be fully torn down after filming, became a tourist attraction. The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, a group of enthusiasts of the film, purchased the building and site from Ohio for one dollar in 2000 and took up maintaining it as a historical landmark, both as its purpose as a prison and as the filming site. A 2019 report estimated the attraction to be earning $16 million in annual revenue. Many of the rooms and props remain there, including the false pipe through which Andy escapes, and a portion of the oak tree from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011. The surrounding area is also visited by fans, while local businesses market ""Shawshanwiches"" and Bundt cakes in the shape of the prison. According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield), tourism in the area had increased every year since The Shawshank Redemption premiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy. As of 2019, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St Croix. The trail earned $16.9 million in revenue in 2018.</p><p>In late August 2014, a series of events was held in Mansfield to celebrate the film\'s 20th anniversary including a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, a bus tour of certain filming locations, and a cocktail party at the reformatory. Cast from the film attended some of the events, including Gunton, Scott Mann, Renee Blaine, and James Kisicki. The 25th anniversary was similarly celebrated in August 2019. Guests included Darabont, Blaine, Mann, Gunton, Alfonso Freeman, Bellows, Rolston, Claire Slemmer, and Frank Medrano. Darabont stated that only at this event, the first time he had returned to Mansfield, was he able to realize the lasting impact of the film, stating, ""It is a very surreal feeling to be back all these years later and people are still talking about it.""</p><h4>Critical reassessment</h4><p>Contemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 91% approval rating from 81 critics, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The consensus reads, ""The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances."" The film also has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 21 critics indicating ""universal acclaim"".</p><p>In 1999, film critic Roger Ebert listed Shawshank on his list of The Great Movies. The film has been nominated for, or appeared on, the American Film Institute\'s lists celebrating the top 100 film or film-related topics. In 1998, it was nominated for AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movies list, and was number 72 on the 2007 revised list, outranking Forrest Gump (76) and Pulp Fiction (94). It was also number 23 on AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Cheers (2006) list charting inspiring films. The characters of Andy and Warden Norton received nominations for AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains list; AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list for ""Get busy livin\', or get busy dyin\'""; AFI\'s 100 Years...100 Songs list for ""Sull\'aria ... che soave zeffiretto"" (from The Marriage of Figaro); and AFI\'s 100 Years of Film Scores for Newman\'s work.</p><p>In 2005, the Writers Guild of America listed Darabont\'s screenplay at number 22 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays, and in 2006, Film4 listed it number 13 on its list of 50 Films to See Before You Die. In 2014, The Shawshank Redemption was named Hollywood\'s fourth-favorite film, based on a survey of 2,120 Hollywood-based entertainment industry members; entertainment lawyers skewed the most towards the film. In 2017, The Daily Telegraph named it the 17th-best prison film ever made, and USA Today listed it as one of the 50 best films of all time. In 2019, GamesRadar+ listed its ending as one of the best of all time.</p><p>The Shawshank Redemption appeared on several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s, by outlets including: Paste and NME (2012), Complex (2013), CHUD.com (2014), MSN (2015), TheWrap, Maxim, and Rolling Stone (all 2017).</p><h4>Cultural impact</h4><p>In November 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrated the film\'s 20th anniversary with a special one-night screening at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California. In 2015, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Darabont responded: ""I can think of no greater honor than for The Shawshank Redemption to be considered part of our country\'s cinematic legacy."" Variety said that the word ""Shawshank"" could be used to instantly convey images of a prison.</p><p>The significant and enduring public appreciation for the film has often been difficult for critics to define. In an interview, Freeman said, ""About everywhere you go, people say, \'The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw\'"" and that such praise ""Just comes out of them"". Robbins said, ""I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, \'That movie changed my life\' "". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, ""If that isn\'t the best, it\'s one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers\' minds, it\'s probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it."" In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was ""a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe"". Speaking on the film\'s 25th anniversary, Darabont said that older generations were sharing it with younger generations, contributing to its longevity.</p><p>It has been the number-one film on IMDb\'s user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather, having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s. In the United Kingdom, readers of Empire voted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four on Empire\'s 2008 list of ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"" and their 2017 list of ""The 100 Greatest Movies"". In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their favorite film of all time. It regularly appears on Empire\'s top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll by Sky UK (it lost to Forrest Gump), and ranked as Britain\'s favorite film in a 2015 YouGov poll. When the British Film Institute analyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted that The Shawshank Redemption was not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlike Pulp Fiction which fared better with younger voters, and Gone with the Wind (1939) with older voters.</p><p>A 2017 poll conducted by Gatwick Airport also identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight. When film critic Mark Kermode interviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a ""religious experience"". It was also voted as New Zealand\'s favorite film in a 2015 poll. Lasting fan appreciation has led to it being considered one of the most beloved films of all time.</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt0111161', 'title': 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'fullTitle': 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '1994', 'posters': [], 'backdrops': [], 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt0111161', 'title': 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'fullTitle': 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '1994', 'videoId': 'vi3877612057', 'videoTitle': 'Official Trailer', 'videoDescription': 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ2NDA3MDcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE5NTU0NzE@._V1_.jpg', 'uploadDate': '03/05/2014 14:13:19', 'link': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3877612057', 'linkEmbed': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3877612057/imdb/embed', 'errorMessage': ''}",,"prison,based on the works of stephen king,escape from prison,friendship between men,voice over narration","[{'id': 'tt0468569', 'title': 'The Dark Knight', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNTMwODM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAyMTk2Mw@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '9.0'}, {'id': 'tt0109830', 'title': 'Forrest Gump', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIwODRlZTUtY2U3ZS00Yzg1LWJhNzYtMmZiYmEyNmU1NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_Ratio0.6957_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.8'}, {'id': 'tt0068646', 'title': 'The Godfather', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MyNjYxNmUtYTAwNi00MTYxLWJmNWYtYzZlODY3ZTk3OTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_Ratio0.7053_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '9.2'}, {'id': 'tt0137523', 'title': 'Fight Club', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIzNDU0YzEtYzE5Ni00ZjlkLTk5ZjgtNjM3NWE4YzA3Nzk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.8'}, {'id': 'tt1375666', 'title': 'Inception', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzY3NjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5OTM0Mw@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.8'}, {'id': 'tt0110912', 'title': 'Pulp Fiction', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGNhMDIzZTUtNTBlZi00MTRlLWFjM2ItYzViMjE3YzI5MjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_Ratio0.6860_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.9'}, {'id': 'tt0108052', 'title': ""Schindler's List"", 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE4OTMxMTctNmRhYy00NWE2LTg3YzItYTk3M2UwOTU5Njg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '9.0'}, {'id': 'tt0114369', 'title': 'Se7en', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUwODM5MTctZjczMi00OTk4LTg3NWUtNmVhMTAzNTNjYjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.6'}, {'id': 'tt0816692', 'title': 'Interstellar', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkOTU3MDktN2IxOS00OGEyLWFmMjktY2FiMmZkNWIyODZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.6'}, {'id': 'tt0120689', 'title': 'The Green Mile', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMzQyNjA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTU2NTY3._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.6'}, {'id': 'tt0071562', 'title': 'The Godfather Part II', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMGQzZTItY2JlNC00OWZiLWIyMDctNDk2ZDQ2YjRjMWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_Ratio0.7053_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '9.0'}, {'id': 'tt0133093', 'title': 'The Matrix', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzOTk3OTAtNDQ0Zi00ZTVkLWI0MTEtMDllZjNkYzNjNTc4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '8.7'}]","$25,000,000 (estimated)","$727,327","$28,767,189","$28,884,504"

Love and Thunder has grossed over $760 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022.\r\nPlot\r\nGorr and his daughter, Love, the last of their race, struggle in a barren desert. Despite their prayers to their god, Rapu, Love dies. The god-killing Necrosword calls to Gorr, leading him to Rapu\'s lush realm. After Rapu cruelly mocks and dismisses Gorr\'s plight, he renounces the god, causing Rapu to strangle him. The Necrosword offers itself to Gorr, who kills Rapu with it and vows to kill all gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corruption under the sword\'s influence. After Gorr kills several gods, Thor, who has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, learns of a distress signal from Sif. He parts ways with the team and finds an injured Sif, who warns that Gorr\'s next target is New Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster, Thor\'s ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with stage four terminal cancer. With medical treatment proving ineffective, she travels to New Asgard hoping that Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir, which was previously fractured by Hela, might heal her.\r\nDue to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr\'s attack begins. Thor is surprised to find Foster wielding Mjolnir, but teams up with her, Valkyrie, and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City to warn the other gods and ask for their help in creating an army. The leader of the gods, Zeus, is unwilling to help, thinking they can remain safe and hidden from Gorr in the City; he also believes that Gorr will not be able to achieve his stated goal of visiting the realm of Eternity, where he (Gorr) will be granted one wish, presumably to destroy all gods. As a security precaution, Zeus orders the group\'s capture to prevent them from exposing the City\'s location to Gorr. When Zeus injures Korg, Thor impales Zeus with his thunderbolt which Valkyrie steals before they escape to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster\'s cancer diagnosis, and the two rekindle their relationship.\r\nThe group arrive at the Shadow Realm but are unable to locate the children. Foster sees ancient drawings that depict Thor\'s battle-axe Stormbreaker as a way to summon the Bifrost to enter Eternity, and deduces the trap laid out by Gorr. She throws away Stormbreaker to prevent Gorr from accessing it. However, Gorr overpowers the group and threatens to kill Foster, forcing Thor to summon it back. Gorr successfully steals Stormbreaker and injures Valkyrie before a weakened Foster collapses.\r\nUpon traveling back to New Asgard, Thor discovers that Foster’s Thor form is not allowing her body to naturally fight the cancer. Due to this, Thor travels to Eternity\'s altar alone, and using Zeus\'s thunderbolt, imbues the children with his power to fight Gorr\'s monsters while he battles Gorr. When Foster senses that Gorr is about to kill Thor, she joins the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but the three are brought into Eternity\'s realm. With Gorr poised to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor then leaves Gorr to make his decision and attends to Foster, who succumbs to her illness and dies in his arms. Moved by their display, Gorr wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which it grants. As Gorr dies from the curse, he requests Thor to take care of Love.\r\nIn the aftermath, the children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif begin training them, and a monument in honor of Foster is built. ""Uncle"" Thor adopts Love, who joins him in his heroics; with the former wielding Mjolnir and the latter wielding Stormbreaker, they race into battle as the eponymous ""Love and Thunder.""\r\nIn a mid-credits scene, back in Omnipotence City, a recuperating Zeus sends his son Hercules to kill Thor. In a post-credits scene, Foster arrives at the gates of Valhalla, where Heimdall welcomes her.\r\nCast\r\nChris Hemsworth as Thor:An Avenger and the former king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Director Taika Waititi said that Thor is going through a midlife crisis in the film, as he is ""just trying to figure out his purpose, trying to figure out exactly who he is and why he\'s a hero or whether he should be a hero"". Hemsworth\'s twin sons Sasha and Tristan portray Thor as a child.\r\nChristian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher:A scarred wielder of the Necrosword and manipulator of shadows who seeks the extinction of the gods. Waititi described Gorr as being ""very formidable"" and layered. Bale felt the character had a ""sort of a Nosferatu slight attitude"", and took inspiration from the music video for the Aphex Twin song ""Come to Daddy"" (1997). Waititi opted to change Gorr\'s facial features in the film since his original look in the comics resembles Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter film series.\r\nTessa Thompson as Valkyrie:The king of New Asgard, based on the mythological being Brynhildr. Thompson and producer Kevin Feige said the character\'s bisexuality would be addressed in the film. Waititi said Valkyrie had to adjust to the bureaucratic aspects of ruling, away from the battlefield, such as dealing with the infrastructure and economy of New Asgard and hosting delegates from other countries.\r\nJaimie Alexander as Sif: An Asgardian warrior and Thor\'s childhood friend, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.\r\nTaika Waititi as Korg: A Kronan gladiator who befriended Thor. Waititi also voices the Kronan god Ninny of the Nonny.\r\nRussell Crowe as Zeus:The king of the Olympians, based on the Greek mythological deity of the same name. Crowe wanted to perform the role in a Greek accent, but Waititi thought it would sound ""too silly"", so he had Crowe do takes in both a Greek and British accent. Waititi finally concluded that Crowe was correct and used the Greek accent in the final film.\r\nNatalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor:An astrophysicist and Thor\'s ex-girlfriend who is undergoing cancer treatment and who gains powers to become the Mighty Thor by wielding a reconstructed Mjolnir, the hammer previously wielded by Thor. Portman, who did not appear in the previous film Thor: Ragnarok (2017), agreed to return after a meeting with Waititi, who said Foster\'s return to Thor\'s life after eight years would be a big adjustment for him since she has had another life without him. Waititi added that Foster showing up dressed like Thor would be a ""real mindfuck"" for him.\r\nAdditionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy are featured in the film, with Chris Pratt, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, reprising their respective MCU roles as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, Kraglin Obfonteri, Groot and Rocket. Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Luke Hemsworth reprise their roles as Asgardian actors respectively playing Loki, Odin, and Thor from Ragnarok, with Melissa McCarthy joining them as an Asgardian actress playing Hela, and McCarthy\'s husband Ben Falcone as the stage manager. Miek, who previously appeared in Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame (2019) via CGI, is voiced by Stephen Murdoch, while Carly Rees provides the motion capture performance for the character. Also returning from previous MCU media are Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård as Foster\'s colleagues Darcy Lewis and Erik Selvig, respectively, and Idris Elba as Heimdall in the post-credits scene. Daley Pearson appears as New Asgard tour guide Darryl, after first portraying the role in Marvel Studios\' Team Thor short film series. Archive footage from previous MCU films of Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Zachary Levi as Fandral is featured at the beginning of the film. Chanique Greyling portrays a young Frigga during a flashback sequence.\r\nDeities introduced in the film include Simon Russell Beale as the Olympian god Dionysus, Jonathan Brugh (who appeared in Waititi\'s 2014 film What We Do in the Shadows) as Rapu, a god from Gorr\'s home planet who becomes his first victim, Akosia Sabet as Bast, a goddess who is a member of both the Heliopolitan and Wakandan pantheons, Kuni Hashimoto as the Japanese god Jademurai, and Carmen Foon as the Roman goddess Minerva. Also appearing in the film are Kieron L. Dyer as Axl, Heimdall\'s son, Chris Hemsworth\'s daughter India as Love, Gorr\'s daughter, and Stephen Curry as Yakan, the ruler of the planet Indigarr. Cameos in the film include Bale, Portman, and Waititi\'s children as New Asgard children, Hemsworth\'s wife Elsa Pataky as the wolf woman who was one of Thor\'s past lovers, Indiana Evans as one of the Zeusettes, Jenny Morris as a New Asgard citizen, Chloé Gouneau as Foster\'s mother Elaine in a flashback sequence, Dave Cory as Dwayne, a Kronan who becomes Korg\'s partner in a romantic relationship, and Brett Goldstein as Zeus\' son Hercules in the mid-credits scene.\r\nJeff Goldblum and Peter Dinklage were both originally set to reprise their respective roles as Grandmaster from previous MCU media and Eitri from Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but their scenes were cut from the theatrical release. Lena Headey was also set to appear in the film, but her scenes were cut as well.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nShortly after the release of the third Thor film, Thor: Ragnarok, in November 2017, that film\'s director Taika Waititi and executives from Marvel Studios met to discuss ideas for another film, which was green-lit following the positive responses to Ragnarok. Chris Hemsworth indicated in January 2018 that he was interested in continuing to play Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), despite his contract with Marvel Studios being set to end with his role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). By then, Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed what they would want in a potential fourth Thor film, and Hemsworth said a month later that he would consider returning if there was ""another great script"". Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in the MCU films, believed in April 2019 that a pitch had been made for a Ragnarok sequel that involved Waititi returning. Hemsworth said then that he would continue to play Thor for as long as possible, crediting Waititi with revitalizing his interest in the role after he became exhausted and underwhelmed with it prior to making Ragnarok.\r\nIn July 2019, Waititi officially signed on to write and direct a fourth Thor film, with Hemsworth expected to reprise his role. Waititi was not interested in repeating what they did with Ragnarok, instead wanting to do ""something more interesting for myself to keep the whole thing ignited and to make sure that I\'m feeling creatively stimulated"". Later that month, at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the film as Thor: Love and Thunder, with a release date of November 5, 2021. Hemsworth and Thompson were confirmed to be returning along with Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Foster from Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013). Portman agreed to return to the franchise, after her character was not included in Ragnarok, following a single meeting with Waititi, who was given creative freedom from Marvel Studios to reimagine her role in the film, in which he offered to portray the character in a different and fresh way, with a ""license to be adventurous and fun and funny"". Thompson and Feige added that Valkyrie\'s bisexuality would be addressed in the sequel, retroactively making her Marvel Studios\' first LGBTQ superhero. Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum was producing the film alongside Feige. Hemsworth, who also served as an executive producer on Love and Thunder, was paid $20 million upfront to star in the film, an increase from the $15 million upfront salary he earned for each of his appearances in Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Endgame.\r\nDon Harwin, the Minister for the Arts for the Australian state of New South Wales, announced at the end of July that Thor: Love and Thunder would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney back-to-back with Marvel Studios\' Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), with work set to begin on Love and Thunder there in March 2020 ahead of an August 2020 filming start. The production was set to receive over AU$24 million (US$18 million) of subsidies from the Australian and New South Wales governments. Marvel Studios vice president David Grant said shooting the two films back-to-back would provide continuous employment for local crews, with Love and Thunder expected to generate over AU$178 million (US$134 million) for the local economy. He added that the studio would work with ""local educational institutions in creating internship opportunities"". Jeff Goldblum said in August 2019 that there was a chance he could reprise his Ragnarok role of the Grandmaster in the sequel, and Waititi confirmed in October that he would be reprising his own role of Korg from Ragnarok and Endgame. Christian Bale entered talks to join the cast in January 2020, with pre-production expected to begin in April. Thompson confirmed a month later that Bale would star as the villain in the film, while Vin Diesel, who voices Groot in the MCU films, said he had discussed the film with Waititi and had been told the Guardians of the Galaxy would be appearing in it. In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the COVID-19 pandemic, moving Thor: Love and Thunder\'s release date to February 18, 2022. Pre-production on the film was delayed due to the pandemic, with Waititi unsure when production would continue. At the end of the month, Disney moved the release date up to February 11, 2022. By July, filming was set to start in early 2021.\r\nWriting\r\nWhen announcing the film in July 2019, Waititi said it would adapt elements from Jason Aaron\'s Mighty Thor comic books by having Foster become a hero called the Mighty Thor. Feige said that the film would include a lot of elements from Marvel comics and that the story line of Foster becoming the Mighty Thor would be an important part, explaining that Marvel considered the Mighty Thor run to be one of the best recent comic books. Waititi read the comic while working on Ragnarok, and when he agreed to direct another Thor film, he told Marvel that he wanted to include Foster as the Mighty Thor. The studio agreed to adapt Aaron\'s storyline and include Portman following discussions with Waititi about where the story could lead. Waititi said they stuck close to Foster\'s storyline from those comics and tried to adapt its best parts. He also explained that Thor having his axe Stormbreaker and then seeing his hammer Mjolnir return ""in the hands of someone else"" and ""no longer his hammer"" would explore ""the idea that someone\'s taking his place"", which he felt some fans assumed would occur, but did not believe this as such. Aaron served as a consultant on the film. A. C. Bradley, the head writer of the animated series What If...?, pitched an episode of that series in which Foster would have become Thor, but the idea was rejected because the storyline was already being used for Love and Thunder.\r\nIn August, Waititi was reported to have completed a script for the film, but he denied this later that month. While promoting his film Jojo Rabbit in October, Waititi said he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, but the story would change throughout filming and editing. He was unsure if the film would include the storyline from Aaron\'s run in which Foster suffers from breast cancer, which he said was a powerful part of the comics. Portman later said Foster\'s treatment from cancer would be explored in the film. Waititi added that Marvel was still discussing how much time would pass between Endgame and Love and Thunder, and that this would affect whether Thor is still carrying the extra weight he is depicted with in Endgame, which earned him the nicknames ""Fat Thor"" and ""Bro Thor"". Waititi did note that he wanted to ""keep changing it up with Thor. He\'s so interesting when he\'s changing all the time."" The film is set eight years after Thor and Foster broke up, around 2024. Waititi also acknowledged fans ""shipping"" Valkyrie with Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel but said he did not intend to include a romantic relationship between the pair because he would rather surprise fans than do something by popular demand. Jennifer Kaytin Robinson was hired to work on the film\'s screenplay with Waititi in February 2020. Waititi received sole screenplay credit on the film\'s theatrical poster, with Robinson credited with him for the story, before the final credits from the Writers Guild of America credited both Waititi and Robinson as the film\'s writers.\r\nThor: Love and Thunder follows Thor as he attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie, Korg, and Foster to stop Gorr the God Butcher from eliminating all gods. Four or five drafts of the screenplay had been completed by mid-April 2020, when Waititi said the sequel was ""so over the top now in the very best way"" and would make Ragnarok look like a ""run of the mill, very safe film"" by doubling down on its crazier aspects. He wanted to up the ante and make the film as if ""10-year-olds told us what should be in a movie and we said yes to every single thing."" Waititi added that the film would explore more of Korg\'s Kronan culture and indicated that it would include the Space Sharks alien race from the comics. He expressed interest in featuring the character Beta Ray Bill, but was unsure at that point if he would. The film also features Falligar the Behemoth, one of the gods slain by Gorr, the cosmic wish-granting entity Eternity, Thor\'s magical goats Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder, based on the Norse mythological animals Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr, and Warsong, Valkyrie\'s winged steed. The steed was renamed from Aragorn as in the comics to Warsong for Love and Thunder, after previously appearing unnamed in Ragnarok and Endgame.\r\nAt the end of July, Waititi said they had been writing the script off and on for over a year and he was taking another pass on it that week. He said it was very romantic, and explained that he wanted to make a romance film because he wanted to make something that he had not done before, and, as such, wrote the film as a love story. He later said the film was ""about love, with superheroes and outer space"", and that he wanted to ""embrace this thing that I was always a bit dismissive of, and explore this idea of love, and show characters who do believe in love"". That October, Hemsworth said Waititi was still writing the script and expressed his excitement for doing something drastically different with his character, as he did in his previous three MCU films. Waititi later described Love and Thunder as the craziest film he had ever made and explained that each element was intended to not make sense. He said it would have its own ""distinct flavour"" from Ragnarok, which he called a 1970s space opera with a festive, party-like tone. He saw this film as a 1980s adventure, taking inspiration from posters for films such as Conan the Barbarian (1982) and The Beastmaster (1982) as well as art seen on vans in Venice Beach, with the works of Jack Kirby and the cover of ""old"" Mills & Boon romance novels also serving as ""visual touchstones"" for the film. He said it was not serious or dramatic, but it did explore themes such as love, loss, and ""our place in the world"" while making the characters ask themselves the questions: ""What is your purpose? What is the reason that you\'re a hero, and what do you do when you have these powers?""\r\nJames Gunn, the writer and director of the three Guardians of the Galaxy films, consulted on how the Guardians characters were used in Love and Thunder, with Gunn and Waititi discussing where the characters were going before Waititi began writing. Waititi read Gunn\'s script for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), which is set after Love and Thunder, and then Gunn read Waititi\'s script and shared his thoughts, asking for some adjustments to be made. In January 2021, Gunn said the Guardians were ""in great hands"" with Waititi, and he later praised Waititi\'s work on the script. Chris Pratt said Love and Thunder would continue the rivalry between Guardians leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord and Thor that was established in Infinity War and Endgame, while Karen Gillan said Waititi brought out the ""bonkers side"" of Nebula through her ""pure aggression"".\r\nPre-production\r\nPre-production began in Australia by October 2020. A month later, Chris Pratt was revealed to be reprising his role as Guardians of the Galaxy leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord. Given the ensemble nature of the cast, industry insiders described the film as feeling like ""Avengers 5"". In December, Feige revealed that the film\'s release was delayed again, this time to May 6, 2022, and he announced that Bale would portray Gorr the God Butcher in the film. Jaimie Alexander was also revealed to be reprising her MCU role, returning as Sif from the first two Thor films, alongside other members and allies of the Guardians of the Galaxy: Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Sean Gunn as Kraglin Obfonteri; Gunn also provides on set reference for Guardians member Rocket. Matt Damon was set to appear, after making a cameo appearance in Ragnarok as an Asgardian actor playing Loki. He received special permission to enter Australia, despite the country\'s strict travel restrictions during the pandemic, since Love and Thunder was providing jobs for Australians. This prompted criticism as it was perceived that Damon, who traveled with his family, received preferential treatment to enter when many Australian nationals abroad were unable to return to the country. Sam Neill—who appeared alongside Damon in Ragnarok as an actor playing Odin—said there was a good chance he would be in the film as well, as long as he could travel from New Zealand to Australia during the pandemic.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on January 26, 2021, at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, under the working title The Big Salad. Barry ""Baz"" Idoine serves as the cinematographer, after previously working with Waititi on the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian. Filming was delayed from an initial August 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial Light & Magic provided the same StageCraft virtual production technology used on The Mandalorian which Waititi directed an episode of, creating a custom volume space at Fox Studios Australia. It featured more LED panels and offered a higher resolution than the original volume created for The Mandalorian. Waititi also used Satellite Lab\'s PlateLight technology (after previously using their Dynamiclight technology on Ragnarok), which is a special rig designed to capture multiple lighting set-ups simultaneously within a single shot at a high frame rate, allowing Waititi to select which lighting set up he would like in post-production. Waititi believed he was able to shoot Love and Thunder more efficiently than Ragnarok due to already having experience working on a Marvel Studios film.\r\nFilming occurred at Centennial Park in Sydney in early February, with Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, and Pratt completing their scenes shortly afterward. In early March, set photos revealed Damon and Neill were reprising their roles as the Asgardian actors playing Loki and Odin, along with Luke Hemsworth in his Ragnarok role as the actor playing Thor. Melissa McCarthy was also revealed to be portraying an actress playing Hela alongside her husband Ben Falcone in an undisclosed role; these cameos were for a sequence where actors reenact scenes from Ragnarok. Damon filmed his part over two days. Alexander completed filming her scenes by the end of the month, while Goldblum was confirmed to appear as the Grandmaster, and Russell Crowe was revealed to be portraying Zeus in what was described as a ""fun cameo"". Crowe was originally set to play Satan in the film before his character was changed to Zeus. Crowe finished filming his scenes in April. At the beginning of May, Waititi said there were four weeks left of shooting, while Idoine said he would continue work on the film through the end of 2021. Filming wrapped on June 1, 2021, by which point Neill had revealed that singer Jenny Morris would appear in the film. Goldblum and Peter Dinklage, who was set to reprise his role as Eitri from Infinity War, had their scenes cut from the theatrical release, as did Lena Headey, who was approached by Waititi for a role in the film.\r\nPost-production\r\nWaititi said in early June 2021 that post-production would be completed by February 2022. Later in June, Diesel was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Groot. In October 2021, the film\'s release date was delayed to July 8, 2022, while Simon Russell Beale was revealed to be appearing. Additional photography for the film took place in early 2022. At the start of March, further reshoots were revealed to be happening ""in the coming weeks"", and were said to have begun with Bale by the week of March 18. With the release of the teaser trailer in April, Bradley Cooper was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Rocket, and the following month, Akosia Sabet was revealed to be appearing as the goddess Bast. Following the appearance of Brett Goldstein in the film\'s mid-credits scene as Hercules, Waititi revealed in July 2022 that Feige ""really wanted him"" to be cast for that role.\r\nVisual effects for the film were created by Wētā FX, Rising Sun Pictures, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Raynault VFX, Base FX, EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani, Mammal Studios, Fin Design + Effects, and Cinesite. Matthew Schmidt, Peter S. Elliot, Tim Roche, and Jennifer Vecchiarello serve as the film\'s editors. Perception designed the film\'s main-on-end title sequence, drawing inspiration from 1980s rock band logos and designing approximately 250 custom fonts for the sequence.\r\nMusic\r\nIn December 2021, Michael Giacchino revealed that he would be scoring the film; he previously scored Doctor Strange (2016) and the MCU Spider-Man trilogy for Marvel Studios, as well as Waititi\'s previous film Jojo Rabbit (2019). A soundtrack album, featuring Giacchino\'s original themes along with the score composed by him and Nami Melumad, was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 6, 2022. The single ""Mama\'s Got a Brand New Hammer"", the film\'s main suite, was released on June 30. Waititi wanted the music to reflect the same aesthetic of the film with its ""bombastic, loud, colorful palette"". ""Sweet Child o\' Mine"" by Guns N\' Roses is featured in the film, given Guns N\' Roses is one of Waititi\'s favorite bands, and helped ""reflect the sort of crazy adventure that we\'re presenting""; the song was also used in the film\'s marketing. The film features the song ""Rainbow in the Dark"" by Dio, according to Wendy Dio, widow of band member Ronnie James Dio.\r\nMarketing\r\nLego sets and Hasbro figures based on the film were revealed in February 2022, with additional Lego sets and Funko Pops revealed that April. The teaser trailer was released on April 18, and commentators discussed its ending, which debuted Portman\'s Foster in the Mighty Thor costume and wielding a restored version of Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir. Marco Vito Oddo of Collider and Ryan Parker from The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the use of ""Sweet Child o\' Mine"", which Oddo felt indicated Waititi would ""keep the hard rock aesthetics that helped Thor: Ragnarok become a huge success"", while Parker called it a ""bright, stylish, fun trailer sets a tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form"". Justin Harp of Digital Spy felt the humor from Ragnarok was ""clearly back in this film too"", while Tom Power of TechRadar felt the trailer was a ""superhero, intergalactic glam rock feast for the senses"" and contained intriguing footage that did a good job of teasing the film. Both The Ringer\'s Daniel Chin and Empire\'s Sophie Butcher highlighted the trailer\'s focus on Thor\'s journey of self-discovery as well as the lack of footage of Christian Bale\'s Gorr. Chin remarked that the trailer was ""dedicated to catching up with Thor as he rediscovers himself"", and was excited for Portman\'s performance as Foster. He thought the trailer was a ""far cry from the Thor we witnessed over a decade ago, as the franchise has transformed into a full-blown space comedy"". Butcher felt the trailer\'s introspection was not surprising due to the film being set after Endgame, and said the trailer was brief but exciting. The trailer had 209 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the seventh most viewed trailer in that time period.\r\nA second trailer was released on May 23, during Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Eastern Conference Finals. Many commentators highlighted Christian Bale\'s appearance as Gorr the God Butcher in the trailer. Eric Francisco of Inverse noted the similar comedic tone from Ragnarok while adding ""some darker shades"" with the inclusion of Gorr. He said Bale brought an ""absolutely terrifying vision of Gorr the God Butcher to the screen"", adding that it appears Hemsworth was ready to pass the mantle of Thor to Portman. Jennifer Ouellette of Ars Technica noted that Gorr\'s scenes featured a different color palette, being shown in ""primarily gray tones"", which she felt made the contrast between other characters ""more stark"". Zach Seemayer from Entertainment Tonight felt that it ""gives fans everything they\'ve been hoping for from the brief flashes of important moments from the first trailer in April"", citing scenes featuring Portman\'s the Mighty Thor, Thor ""living up to his \'Space Viking\' title"", and Gorr\'s footage. Similarly, The A.V. Club\'s Sam Barsanti and William Hughes also highlighted Portman and Hemsworth\'s Thor, Gorr\'s appearance, in addition to noting other comedic moments in the trailer, such as when Thor is nude after Russell Crowe\'s Zeus exposes his disguise. Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer ""the real deal"" compared to the teaser, and noted similarities with the Masters of the Universe franchise. He speculated that Thor and Foster would be ""pining"" for each other despite it being 11 years after their first encounter, and called it ""a little depressing"", as he hoped the two ""A+ dating specimens would have moved on"". He also highlighted how Gorr\'s scenes played with color and contrast, and the ""interplay"" between Foster and Valkyrie. Footage from the film was also featured in the 2022 CineEurope presentation.\r\nUlta Beauty partnered with Marvel Studios to created a makeup collection based on the film. On July 9, 2022, Taika Waititi and Tessa Thompson appeared on Vanity Fair\'s Notes on a Scene series, analysing the ""Taste the Rainbow"" scene. The video was met with criticism for what some viewers perceived as Waititi and Thompson\'s ""mocking"" the visual effects, on the same day that multiple VFX artists who worked for Marvel had spoken out against being ""underpaid"" and ""overworked"" by the studio\'s productions.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nThor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on June 23, 2022. The film was theatrically released in Australia on July 6, 2022, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand on July 7, and in the United States on July 8, 2022, in 4DX, RealD 3D, IMAX, ScreenX, and Dolby Cinema. It was previously set for release on November 5, 2021, but was delayed to February 18, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved up a week to February 11 once Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was rescheduled from November 2021 to March 2022, and delayed once again to May 6, 2022, in December 2020, before shifting to the July 2022 date in October 2021. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The El Capitan Theatre hosted two sensory inclusive screenings of the film in July 2022, featuring expedited check in, a ""calming"" lobby, reduced capacity, and gift bags for guests with items to aid with anxiety.\r\nThe film was not released in Malaysia, Brunei, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Variety reported that the Malaysian release did not happen because Disney refused to make cuts to the film requested by the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia. The Malaysian government confirmed that this was due to LGBT elements not being cut from the film.\r\nHome media\r\nThor: Love and Thunder was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version. It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 27. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nAs of October 13, 2022, Thor: Love and Thunder has grossed $343.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $417.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $760.7 million. It is the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022. The film\'s opening weekend earned $303.3 million globally, of which IMAX contributed $23 million, making it the third-largest July debut of all-time for the format.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $140–167 million from 4,375 theatres in its opening weekend, along with a total gross of $345–420 million. The film earned $69.5 million on its first day, which included $29 million from Thursday night previews. This marked the second-highest opening day and preview night of 2022, behind fellow MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, as well as the fifth-highest opening day ever for an MCU film. Its opening weekend earned $144.2 million, which was the largest debut of the Thor franchise, the twelfth-largest for the MCU, and the third-largest for 2022, behind Multiverse of Madness ($187.4 million) and Jurassic World Dominion ($145 million). Of the $144.2 million figure, over $13.8 million came from IMAX, making it the fifth-highest July debut of all-time for the format domestically. Love and Thunder was also the sixth film in the COVID-19 pandemic to earn over 10 million theater admissions in its opening weekend. Its second weekend grossed $46.6 million, a decline of nearly 68%, representing one of the MCU\'s largest sophomore weekend drops. Deadline Hollywood attributed this to its CinemaScore grade and generally mixed reception from critics and audiences. In its third weekend the film made $22.6 million, finishing second behind newcomer Nope.\r\nOutside of North America, Love and Thunder grossed $15.7 million from 17 markets on its opening day, surpassing the first-day overall results of Thor: Ragnarok (2017) by 39%. Its weekend gross was $159.2 million from 47 markets, making it the MCU\'s ninth-largest overseas debut ever and the third-largest for any Hollywood film released in the COVID-19 pandemic. It surpassed Ragnarok\'s opening by 19%. IMAX contributed $9.2 million to the weekend, becoming the third-largest July debut ever overseas.

As of July 24, 2022, the film\'s largest markets are the United Kingdom ($31.5 million), Australia ($25.5 million), Mexico ($23.2 million), South Korea ($22.3 million), and Brazil ($17.2 million).\r\nCritical response\r\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 64%, with an average rating of 6.4/10, based on 423 reviews. The site\'s critics consensus reads: ""In some ways, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like Ragnarok redux – but overall, it offers enough fast-paced fun to make this a worthy addition to the MCU."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported 77% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.\r\nIn early reactions to the film, Screen Rant noted that the performances from Christian Bale and Natalie Portman were praised. Owen Gleiberman of Variety said there are ""many words to describe"", stating ""comedy is all part of the package"" that made Ragnarok ""such a genuine Marvel wildflower."" Gleiberman wrote that the film ""sustains its freshness"" to the end, although it started with a ""more awkward"" first act with the Guardians of the Galaxy. He also praised Gorr\'s characterization–a ""power""–and concluded the review by saying he felt ""moved"" by the end. David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised the film for its light tone and humorous moments, writing that "" Waititi continues to brighten up the Thor movies with his own flavor of wackiness, which is as welcome here as it was grating in Jojo Rabbit."" However, he noted that the film ""is clouded by its uncertain place in the universe from the moment it starts"". Nick Allen at RogerEbert.com gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that it was ""more or less a victory lap for all that achieved with his previous Marvel film, the often hilarious, rousing, and plainly refreshing Thor: Ragnarok. And while it has too many familiar flourishes and jokes, this entertaining sequel is still a force for good, with enough visual ambition and heart in front of and behind the camera to stand on its own."" He praised Natalie Portman\'s performance that ""conveys why it\'s great to see Jane again"" and Christian Bale\'s ""striking"" role that he considered as the ""closest we\'ll get to seeing him play Pennywise the Clown, with a dash of Voldemort, but tethered to the same humility brings to his most human, humbled characters.""\r\nTodd Gilchrist at The A.V. Club graded the film \'B\', feeling that it did "" the cheeky, sentimental tone of the nearly universally beloved Thor: Ragnarok, and propels its eponymous hero into new adventures that bring full circle a journey that started with the very first, much-less-beloved Thor back in 2011."" He praised Portman and Bale\'s performances, with the latter\'s character being considered ""the most interesting and sympathetic Marvel adversary since Michael B. Jordan\'s Killmonger in Black Panther"", and Waititi\'s ""distinctive imagery that may disturb and upset some viewers"", outpacing Sam Raimi\'s accomplishments in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly also gave a similar grade, feeling that although ""its cheerful melee of starry cameos, in-jokes, and Cliffs-Notes mythology, feels a lot like franchise fatigue, it also has frequent moments of gonzo charm, thanks largely to the Technicolor lunacy of writer-director and a cast that seems inordinately game to follow his lead.""\r\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter stated, ""The movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder."" David Sims of The Atlantic felt the film delivered a ""usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there\'s not enough heft behind the flashiness."" He found it a ""hasty-feeling mess of a movie"" and ""disappointing given that it\'s directed by"", although he praised Bale and Russell Crowe\'s performances. David Fear of Rolling Stone felt the film was ""oddly unengaging; even the love and death aspects often feel like cold transmissions from distant sources."" He saw it as a mess due to the ""collision of competing tones, subplots, conceptual big swings and chaos masquerading as pathos"". Eric Francisco at Inverse found Chris Hemsworth\'s Thor in the film becoming ""meandering, left in the purgatory of a roundabout tale that makes some sense on paper but in execution fails to maintain viscosity"", feeling that Marvel ""doesn\'t know what to do with anymore."" He felt that despite ""striv for an emotional story about loss and love, the movie gets in its own way with tiresome relentless comedy, distracted plotting, and uneven tone."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, calling it ""one of the goofiest and least consequential sagas in MCU history—an allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie.""\r\nAt the London premiere Q&A, in response to the question ""How gay will the film be?"" Waititi exclaimed that it would be ""super gay""; critics and moviegoers who saw the film expressed disappointment that this statement was false and that Marvel queerbaited the audience. Jade King of The Gamer felt expectations from queer audiences for prominent ""LGBTQ+ characters and themes"" in Thor: Love and Thunder were not met, writing that ""the film\'s creators have been out there talking up the LGBTQ+ representation when it isn\'t really a massive part of the experience. it\'s time to temper your expectations and stop letting Marvel continue to queerbait us into disappointment.""\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film is nominated for several awards at the 47th Saturn Awards, including Best Superhero Film, Best Film Costume for Mayes C. Rubeo, and Best Film Make-up for Matteo Silvi and Adam Johansen.\r\nDocumentary special\r\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this film, Assembled: The Making of Thor: Love and Thunder, was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day.\r\nFuture\r\nIn regards to the ""Thor will return"" tagline at the end of the film, Waititi was unaware it was added to the film, stating that it was a surprise to both him and Hemsworth. Waititi was open to returning to direct another Thor film if Hemsworth was also involved, stating the story would need to be ""something surprising and unexpected"", suggesting a low budget road trip film with no fight scenes, similar to Nebraska (2013).', 'html': '<p>Thor: Love and Thunder is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the script with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Jaimie Alexander, Waititi, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman. In the film, Thor attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.</p><p>Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel to Ragnarok by January 2018. Love and Thunder was announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson all set to return, as well as Portman who did not appear in Ragnarok. Waititi wanted to differentiate Love and Thunder from Ragnarok, seeking to make a romance film and 1980s-inspired adventure. He adapted elements from Jason Aaron\'s run on the Mighty Thor comic book, which sees Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst under treatment for cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was revealed later that year including the appearance of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Production was expected to begin in late 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia, and concluded at the beginning of June.</p><p>Thor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on June 23, 2022, and was released in the United States on July 8, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received praise from critics for its light-hearted nature, visuals, and the performances of Bale and Portman, while criticism was aimed at the screenplay, and tonal inconsistency, with many critics deeming the film inferior to Ragnarok. Love and Thunder has grossed over $760 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Gorr and his daughter, Love, the last of their race, struggle in a barren desert. Despite their prayers to their god, Rapu, Love dies. The god-killing Necrosword calls to Gorr, leading him to Rapu\'s lush realm. After Rapu cruelly mocks and dismisses Gorr\'s plight, he renounces the god, causing Rapu to strangle him. The Necrosword offers itself to Gorr, who kills Rapu with it and vows to kill all gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corruption under the sword\'s influence. After Gorr kills several gods, Thor, who has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, learns of a distress signal from Sif. He parts ways with the team and finds an injured Sif, who warns that Gorr\'s next target is New Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster, Thor\'s ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with stage four terminal cancer. With medical treatment proving ineffective, she travels to New Asgard hoping that Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir, which was previously fractured by Hela, might heal her.</p><p>Due to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr\'s attack begins. Thor is surprised to find Foster wielding Mjolnir, but teams up with her, Valkyrie, and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping several Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City to warn the other gods and ask for their help in creating an army. The leader of the gods, Zeus, is unwilling to help, thinking they can remain safe and hidden from Gorr in the City; he also believes that Gorr will not be able to achieve his stated goal of visiting the realm of Eternity, where he (Gorr) will be granted one wish, presumably to destroy all gods. As a security precaution, Zeus orders the group\'s capture to prevent them from exposing the City\'s location to Gorr. When Zeus injures Korg, Thor impales Zeus with his thunderbolt which Valkyrie steals before they escape to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster\'s cancer diagnosis, and the two rekindle their relationship.</p><p>The group arrive at the Shadow Realm but are unable to locate the children. Foster sees ancient drawings that depict Thor\'s battle-axe Stormbreaker as a way to summon the Bifrost to enter Eternity, and deduces the trap laid out by Gorr. She throws away Stormbreaker to prevent Gorr from accessing it. However, Gorr overpowers the group and threatens to kill Foster, forcing Thor to summon it back. Gorr successfully steals Stormbreaker and injures Valkyrie before a weakened Foster collapses.</p><p>Upon traveling back to New Asgard, Thor discovers that Foster’s Thor form is not allowing her body to naturally fight the cancer. Due to this, Thor travels to Eternity\'s altar alone, and using Zeus\'s thunderbolt, imbues the children with his power to fight Gorr\'s monsters while he battles Gorr. When Foster senses that Gorr is about to kill Thor, she joins the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but the three are brought into Eternity\'s realm. With Gorr poised to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor then leaves Gorr to make his decision and attends to Foster, who succumbs to her illness and dies in his arms. Moved by their display, Gorr wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which it grants. As Gorr dies from the curse, he requests Thor to take care of Love.</p><p>In the aftermath, the children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif begin training them, and a monument in honor of Foster is built. ""Uncle"" Thor adopts Love, who joins him in his heroics; with the former wielding Mjolnir and the latter wielding Stormbreaker, they race into battle as the eponymous ""Love and Thunder.""</p><p>In a mid-credits scene, back in Omnipotence City, a recuperating Zeus sends his son Hercules to kill Thor. In a post-credits scene, Foster arrives at the gates of Valhalla, where Heimdall welcomes her.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Chris Hemsworth as Thor:An Avenger and the former king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Director Taika Waititi said that Thor is going through a midlife crisis in the film, as he is ""just trying to figure out his purpose, trying to figure out exactly who he is and why he\'s a hero or whether he should be a hero"". Hemsworth\'s twin sons Sasha and Tristan portray Thor as a child.</li><li>Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher:A scarred wielder of the Necrosword and manipulator of shadows who seeks the extinction of the gods. Waititi described Gorr as being ""very formidable"" and layered. Bale felt the character had a ""sort of a Nosferatu slight attitude"", and took inspiration from the music video for the Aphex Twin song ""Come to Daddy"" (1997). Waititi opted to change Gorr\'s facial features in the film since his original look in the comics resembles Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter film series.</li><li>Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie:The king of New Asgard, based on the mythological being Brynhildr. Thompson and producer Kevin Feige said the character\'s bisexuality would be addressed in the film. Waititi said Valkyrie had to adjust to the bureaucratic aspects of ruling, away from the battlefield, such as dealing with the infrastructure and economy of New Asgard and hosting delegates from other countries.</li><li>Jaimie Alexander as Sif: An Asgardian warrior and Thor\'s childhood friend, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.</li><li>Taika Waititi as Korg: A Kronan gladiator who befriended Thor. Waititi also voices the Kronan god Ninny of the Nonny.</li><li>Russell Crowe as Zeus:The king of the Olympians, based on the Greek mythological deity of the same name. Crowe wanted to perform the role in a Greek accent, but Waititi thought it would sound ""too silly"", so he had Crowe do takes in both a Greek and British accent. Waititi finally concluded that Crowe was correct and used the Greek accent in the final film.</li><li>Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor:An astrophysicist and Thor\'s ex-girlfriend who is undergoing cancer treatment and who gains powers to become the Mighty Thor by wielding a reconstructed Mjolnir, the hammer previously wielded by Thor. Portman, who did not appear in the previous film Thor: Ragnarok (2017), agreed to return after a meeting with Waititi, who said Foster\'s return to Thor\'s life after eight years would be a big adjustment for him since she has had another life without him. Waititi added that Foster showing up dressed like Thor would be a ""real mindfuck"" for him.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy are featured in the film, with Chris Pratt, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, reprising their respective MCU roles as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer, Mantis, Kraglin Obfonteri, Groot and Rocket. Matt Damon, Sam Neill, and Luke Hemsworth reprise their roles as Asgardian actors respectively playing Loki, Odin, and Thor from Ragnarok, with Melissa McCarthy joining them as an Asgardian actress playing Hela, and McCarthy\'s husband Ben Falcone as the stage manager. Miek, who previously appeared in Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame (2019) via CGI, is voiced by Stephen Murdoch, while Carly Rees provides the motion capture performance for the character. Also returning from previous MCU media are Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård as Foster\'s colleagues Darcy Lewis and Erik Selvig, respectively, and Idris Elba as Heimdall in the post-credits scene. Daley Pearson appears as New Asgard tour guide Darryl, after first portraying the role in Marvel Studios\' Team Thor short film series. Archive footage from previous MCU films of Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Zachary Levi as Fandral is featured at the beginning of the film. Chanique Greyling portrays a young Frigga during a flashback sequence.</p><p>Deities introduced in the film include Simon Russell Beale as the Olympian god Dionysus, Jonathan Brugh (who appeared in Waititi\'s 2014 film What We Do in the Shadows) as Rapu, a god from Gorr\'s home planet who becomes his first victim, Akosia Sabet as Bast, a goddess who is a member of both the Heliopolitan and Wakandan pantheons, Kuni Hashimoto as the Japanese god Jademurai, and Carmen Foon as the Roman goddess Minerva. Also appearing in the film are Kieron L. Dyer as Axl, Heimdall\'s son, Chris Hemsworth\'s daughter India as Love, Gorr\'s daughter, and Stephen Curry as Yakan, the ruler of the planet Indigarr. Cameos in the film include Bale, Portman, and Waititi\'s children as New Asgard children, Hemsworth\'s wife Elsa Pataky as the wolf woman who was one of Thor\'s past lovers, Indiana Evans as one of the Zeusettes, Jenny Morris as a New Asgard citizen, Chloé Gouneau as Foster\'s mother Elaine in a flashback sequence, Dave Cory as Dwayne, a Kronan who becomes Korg\'s partner in a romantic relationship, and Brett Goldstein as Zeus\' son Hercules in the mid-credits scene.</p><p>Jeff Goldblum and Peter Dinklage were both originally set to reprise their respective roles as Grandmaster from previous MCU media and Eitri from Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but their scenes were cut from the theatrical release. Lena Headey was also set to appear in the film, but her scenes were cut as well.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>Shortly after the release of the third Thor film, Thor: Ragnarok, in November 2017, that film\'s director Taika Waititi and executives from Marvel Studios met to discuss ideas for another film, which was green-lit following the positive responses to Ragnarok. Chris Hemsworth indicated in January 2018 that he was interested in continuing to play Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), despite his contract with Marvel Studios being set to end with his role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). By then, Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed what they would want in a potential fourth Thor film, and Hemsworth said a month later that he would consider returning if there was ""another great script"". Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in the MCU films, believed in April 2019 that a pitch had been made for a Ragnarok sequel that involved Waititi returning. Hemsworth said then that he would continue to play Thor for as long as possible, crediting Waititi with revitalizing his interest in the role after he became exhausted and underwhelmed with it prior to making Ragnarok.</p><p>In July 2019, Waititi officially signed on to write and direct a fourth Thor film, with Hemsworth expected to reprise his role. Waititi was not interested in repeating what they did with Ragnarok, instead wanting to do ""something more interesting for myself to keep the whole thing ignited and to make sure that I\'m feeling creatively stimulated"". Later that month, at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the film as Thor: Love and Thunder, with a release date of November 5, 2021. Hemsworth and Thompson were confirmed to be returning along with Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Foster from Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013). Portman agreed to return to the franchise, after her character was not included in Ragnarok, following a single meeting with Waititi, who was given creative freedom from Marvel Studios to reimagine her role in the film, in which he offered to portray the character in a different and fresh way, with a ""license to be adventurous and fun and funny"". Thompson and Feige added that Valkyrie\'s bisexuality would be addressed in the sequel, retroactively making her Marvel Studios\' first LGBTQ superhero. Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum was producing the film alongside Feige. Hemsworth, who also served as an executive producer on Love and Thunder, was paid $20 million upfront to star in the film, an increase from the $15 million upfront salary he earned for each of his appearances in Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Endgame.</p><p>Don Harwin, the Minister for the Arts for the Australian state of New South Wales, announced at the end of July that Thor: Love and Thunder would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney back-to-back with Marvel Studios\' Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), with work set to begin on Love and Thunder there in March 2020 ahead of an August 2020 filming start. The production was set to receive over AU$24 million (US$18 million) of subsidies from the Australian and New South Wales governments. Marvel Studios vice president David Grant said shooting the two films back-to-back would provide continuous employment for local crews, with Love and Thunder expected to generate over AU$178 million (US$134 million) for the local economy. He added that the studio would work with ""local educational institutions in creating internship opportunities"". Jeff Goldblum said in August 2019 that there was a chance he could reprise his Ragnarok role of the Grandmaster in the sequel, and Waititi confirmed in October that he would be reprising his own role of Korg from Ragnarok and Endgame. Christian Bale entered talks to join the cast in January 2020, with pre-production expected to begin in April. Thompson confirmed a month later that Bale would star as the villain in the film, while Vin Diesel, who voices Groot in the MCU films, said he had discussed the film with Waititi and had been told the Guardians of the Galaxy would be appearing in it. In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the COVID-19 pandemic, moving Thor: Love and Thunder\'s release date to February 18, 2022. Pre-production on the film was delayed due to the pandemic, with Waititi unsure when production would continue. At the end of the month, Disney moved the release date up to February 11, 2022. By July, filming was set to start in early 2021.</p><h4>Writing</h4><p>When announcing the film in July 2019, Waititi said it would adapt elements from Jason Aaron\'s Mighty Thor comic books by having Foster become a hero called the Mighty Thor. Feige said that the film would include a lot of elements from Marvel comics and that the story line of Foster becoming the Mighty Thor would be an important part, explaining that Marvel considered the Mighty Thor run to be one of the best recent comic books. Waititi read the comic while working on Ragnarok, and when he agreed to direct another Thor film, he told Marvel that he wanted to include Foster as the Mighty Thor. The studio agreed to adapt Aaron\'s storyline and include Portman following discussions with Waititi about where the story could lead. Waititi said they stuck close to Foster\'s storyline from those comics and tried to adapt its best parts. He also explained that Thor having his axe Stormbreaker and then seeing his hammer Mjolnir return ""in the hands of someone else"" and ""no longer his hammer"" would explore ""the idea that someone\'s taking his place"", which he felt some fans assumed would occur, but did not believe this as such. Aaron served as a consultant on the film. A. C. Bradley, the head writer of the animated series What If...?, pitched an episode of that series in which Foster would have become Thor, but the idea was rejected because the storyline was already being used for Love and Thunder.</p><p>In August, Waititi was reported to have completed a script for the film, but he denied this later that month. While promoting his film Jojo Rabbit in October, Waititi said he had completed the first draft of the screenplay, but the story would change throughout filming and editing. He was unsure if the film would include the storyline from Aaron\'s run in which Foster suffers from breast cancer, which he said was a powerful part of the comics. Portman later said Foster\'s treatment from cancer would be explored in the film. Waititi added that Marvel was still discussing how much time would pass between Endgame and Love and Thunder, and that this would affect whether Thor is still carrying the extra weight he is depicted with in Endgame, which earned him the nicknames ""Fat Thor"" and ""Bro Thor"". Waititi did note that he wanted to ""keep changing it up with Thor. He\'s so interesting when he\'s changing all the time."" The film is set eight years after Thor and Foster broke up, around 2024. Waititi also acknowledged fans ""shipping"" Valkyrie with Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel but said he did not intend to include a romantic relationship between the pair because he would rather surprise fans than do something by popular demand. Jennifer Kaytin Robinson was hired to work on the film\'s screenplay with Waititi in February 2020. Waititi received sole screenplay credit on the film\'s theatrical poster, with Robinson credited with him for the story, before the final credits from the Writers Guild of America credited both Waititi and Robinson as the film\'s writers.</p><p>Thor: Love and Thunder follows Thor as he attempts to find inner peace, but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie, Korg, and Foster to stop Gorr the God Butcher from eliminating all gods. Four or five drafts of the screenplay had been completed by mid-April 2020, when Waititi said the sequel was ""so over the top now in the very best way"" and would make Ragnarok look like a ""run of the mill, very safe film"" by doubling down on its crazier aspects. He wanted to up the ante and make the film as if ""10-year-olds told us what should be in a movie and we said yes to every single thing."" Waititi added that the film would explore more of Korg\'s Kronan culture and indicated that it would include the Space Sharks alien race from the comics. He expressed interest in featuring the character Beta Ray Bill, but was unsure at that point if he would. The film also features Falligar the Behemoth, one of the gods slain by Gorr, the cosmic wish-granting entity Eternity, Thor\'s magical goats Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder, based on the Norse mythological animals Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr, and Warsong, Valkyrie\'s winged steed. The steed was renamed from Aragorn as in the comics to Warsong for Love and Thunder, after previously appearing unnamed in Ragnarok and Endgame.</p><p>At the end of July, Waititi said they had been writing the script off and on for over a year and he was taking another pass on it that week. He said it was very romantic, and explained that he wanted to make a romance film because he wanted to make something that he had not done before, and, as such, wrote the film as a love story. He later said the film was ""about love, with superheroes and outer space"", and that he wanted to ""embrace this thing that I was always a bit dismissive of, and explore this idea of love, and show characters who do believe in love"". That October, Hemsworth said Waititi was still writing the script and expressed his excitement for doing something drastically different with his character, as he did in his previous three MCU films. Waititi later described Love and Thunder as the craziest film he had ever made and explained that each element was intended to not make sense. He said it would have its own ""distinct flavour"" from Ragnarok, which he called a 1970s space opera with a festive, party-like tone. He saw this film as a 1980s adventure, taking inspiration from posters for films such as Conan the Barbarian (1982) and The Beastmaster (1982) as well as art seen on vans in Venice Beach, with the works of Jack Kirby and the cover of ""old"" Mills & Boon romance novels also serving as ""visual touchstones"" for the film. He said it was not serious or dramatic, but it did explore themes such as love, loss, and ""our place in the world"" while making the characters ask themselves the questions: ""What is your purpose? What is the reason that you\'re a hero, and what do you do when you have these powers?""</p><p>James Gunn, the writer and director of the three Guardians of the Galaxy films, consulted on how the Guardians characters were used in Love and Thunder, with Gunn and Waititi discussing where the characters were going before Waititi began writing. Waititi read Gunn\'s script for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), which is set after Love and Thunder, and then Gunn read Waititi\'s script and shared his thoughts, asking for some adjustments to be made. In January 2021, Gunn said the Guardians were ""in great hands"" with Waititi, and he later praised Waititi\'s work on the script. Chris Pratt said Love and Thunder would continue the rivalry between Guardians leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord and Thor that was established in Infinity War and Endgame, while Karen Gillan said Waititi brought out the ""bonkers side"" of Nebula through her ""pure aggression"".</p><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>Pre-production began in Australia by October 2020. A month later, Chris Pratt was revealed to be reprising his role as Guardians of the Galaxy leader Peter Quill / Star-Lord. Given the ensemble nature of the cast, industry insiders described the film as feeling like ""Avengers 5"". In December, Feige revealed that the film\'s release was delayed again, this time to May 6, 2022, and he announced that Bale would portray Gorr the God Butcher in the film. Jaimie Alexander was also revealed to be reprising her MCU role, returning as Sif from the first two Thor films, alongside other members and allies of the Guardians of the Galaxy: Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Sean Gunn as Kraglin Obfonteri; Gunn also provides on set reference for Guardians member Rocket. Matt Damon was set to appear, after making a cameo appearance in Ragnarok as an Asgardian actor playing Loki. He received special permission to enter Australia, despite the country\'s strict travel restrictions during the pandemic, since Love and Thunder was providing jobs for Australians. This prompted criticism as it was perceived that Damon, who traveled with his family, received preferential treatment to enter when many Australian nationals abroad were unable to return to the country. Sam Neill—who appeared alongside Damon in Ragnarok as an actor playing Odin—said there was a good chance he would be in the film as well, as long as he could travel from New Zealand to Australia during the pandemic.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began on January 26, 2021, at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, under the working title The Big Salad. Barry ""Baz"" Idoine serves as the cinematographer, after previously working with Waititi on the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian. Filming was delayed from an initial August 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial Light & Magic provided the same StageCraft virtual production technology used on The Mandalorian which Waititi directed an episode of, creating a custom volume space at Fox Studios Australia. It featured more LED panels and offered a higher resolution than the original volume created for The Mandalorian. Waititi also used Satellite Lab\'s PlateLight technology (after previously using their Dynamiclight technology on Ragnarok), which is a special rig designed to capture multiple lighting set-ups simultaneously within a single shot at a high frame rate, allowing Waititi to select which lighting set up he would like in post-production. Waititi believed he was able to shoot Love and Thunder more efficiently than Ragnarok due to already having experience working on a Marvel Studios film.</p><p>Filming occurred at Centennial Park in Sydney in early February, with Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, and Pratt completing their scenes shortly afterward. In early March, set photos revealed Damon and Neill were reprising their roles as the Asgardian actors playing Loki and Odin, along with Luke Hemsworth in his Ragnarok role as the actor playing Thor. Melissa McCarthy was also revealed to be portraying an actress playing Hela alongside her husband Ben Falcone in an undisclosed role; these cameos were for a sequence where actors reenact scenes from Ragnarok. Damon filmed his part over two days. Alexander completed filming her scenes by the end of the month, while Goldblum was confirmed to appear as the Grandmaster, and Russell Crowe was revealed to be portraying Zeus in what was described as a ""fun cameo"". Crowe was originally set to play Satan in the film before his character was changed to Zeus. Crowe finished filming his scenes in April. At the beginning of May, Waititi said there were four weeks left of shooting, while Idoine said he would continue work on the film through the end of 2021. Filming wrapped on June 1, 2021, by which point Neill had revealed that singer Jenny Morris would appear in the film. Goldblum and Peter Dinklage, who was set to reprise his role as Eitri from Infinity War, had their scenes cut from the theatrical release, as did Lena Headey, who was approached by Waititi for a role in the film.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>Waititi said in early June 2021 that post-production would be completed by February 2022. Later in June, Diesel was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Groot. In October 2021, the film\'s release date was delayed to July 8, 2022, while Simon Russell Beale was revealed to be appearing. Additional photography for the film took place in early 2022. At the start of March, further reshoots were revealed to be happening ""in the coming weeks"", and were said to have begun with Bale by the week of March 18. With the release of the teaser trailer in April, Bradley Cooper was confirmed to be reprising his voice role as Rocket, and the following month, Akosia Sabet was revealed to be appearing as the goddess Bast. Following the appearance of Brett Goldstein in the film\'s mid-credits scene as Hercules, Waititi revealed in July 2022 that Feige ""really wanted him"" to be cast for that role.</p><p>Visual effects for the film were created by Wētā FX, Rising Sun Pictures, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Raynault VFX, Base FX, EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani, Mammal Studios, Fin Design + Effects, and Cinesite. Matthew Schmidt, Peter S. Elliot, Tim Roche, and Jennifer Vecchiarello serve as the film\'s editors. Perception designed the film\'s main-on-end title sequence, drawing inspiration from 1980s rock band logos and designing approximately 250 custom fonts for the sequence.</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>In December 2021, Michael Giacchino revealed that he would be scoring the film; he previously scored Doctor Strange (2016) and the MCU Spider-Man trilogy for Marvel Studios, as well as Waititi\'s previous film Jojo Rabbit (2019). A soundtrack album, featuring Giacchino\'s original themes along with the score composed by him and Nami Melumad, was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on July 6, 2022. The single ""Mama\'s Got a Brand New Hammer"", the film\'s main suite, was released on June 30. Waititi wanted the music to reflect the same aesthetic of the film with its ""bombastic, loud, colorful palette"". ""Sweet Child o\' Mine"" by Guns N\' Roses is featured in the film, given Guns N\' Roses is one of Waititi\'s favorite bands, and helped ""reflect the sort of crazy adventure that we\'re presenting""; the song was also used in the film\'s marketing. The film features the song ""Rainbow in the Dark"" by Dio, according to Wendy Dio, widow of band member Ronnie James Dio.</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><p>Lego sets and Hasbro figures based on the film were revealed in February 2022, with additional Lego sets and Funko Pops revealed that April. The teaser trailer was released on April 18, and commentators discussed its ending, which debuted Portman\'s Foster in the Mighty Thor costume and wielding a restored version of Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir. Marco Vito Oddo of Collider and Ryan Parker from The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the use of ""Sweet Child o\' Mine"", which Oddo felt indicated Waititi would ""keep the hard rock aesthetics that helped Thor: Ragnarok become a huge success"", while Parker called it a ""bright, stylish, fun trailer sets a tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form"". Justin Harp of Digital Spy felt the humor from Ragnarok was ""clearly back in this film too"", while Tom Power of TechRadar felt the trailer was a ""superhero, intergalactic glam rock feast for the senses"" and contained intriguing footage that did a good job of teasing the film. Both The Ringer\'s Daniel Chin and Empire\'s Sophie Butcher highlighted the trailer\'s focus on Thor\'s journey of self-discovery as well as the lack of footage of Christian Bale\'s Gorr. Chin remarked that the trailer was ""dedicated to catching up with Thor as he rediscovers himself"", and was excited for Portman\'s performance as Foster. He thought the trailer was a ""far cry from the Thor we witnessed over a decade ago, as the franchise has transformed into a full-blown space comedy"". Butcher felt the trailer\'s introspection was not surprising due to the film being set after Endgame, and said the trailer was brief but exciting. The trailer had 209 million global views in its first 24 hours, becoming the seventh most viewed trailer in that time period.</p><p>A second trailer was released on May 23, during Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Eastern Conference Finals. Many commentators highlighted Christian Bale\'s appearance as Gorr the God Butcher in the trailer. Eric Francisco of Inverse noted the similar comedic tone from Ragnarok while adding ""some darker shades"" with the inclusion of Gorr. He said Bale brought an ""absolutely terrifying vision of Gorr the God Butcher to the screen"", adding that it appears Hemsworth was ready to pass the mantle of Thor to Portman. Jennifer Ouellette of Ars Technica noted that Gorr\'s scenes featured a different color palette, being shown in ""primarily gray tones"", which she felt made the contrast between other characters ""more stark"". Zach Seemayer from Entertainment Tonight felt that it ""gives fans everything they\'ve been hoping for from the brief flashes of important moments from the first trailer in April"", citing scenes featuring Portman\'s the Mighty Thor, Thor ""living up to his \'Space Viking\' title"", and Gorr\'s footage. Similarly, The A.V. Club\'s Sam Barsanti and William Hughes also highlighted Portman and Hemsworth\'s Thor, Gorr\'s appearance, in addition to noting other comedic moments in the trailer, such as when Thor is nude after Russell Crowe\'s Zeus exposes his disguise. Scott Mendelson of Forbes called the trailer ""the real deal"" compared to the teaser, and noted similarities with the Masters of the Universe franchise. He speculated that Thor and Foster would be ""pining"" for each other despite it being 11 years after their first encounter, and called it ""a little depressing"", as he hoped the two ""A+ dating specimens would have moved on"". He also highlighted how Gorr\'s scenes played with color and contrast, and the ""interplay"" between Foster and Valkyrie. Footage from the film was also featured in the 2022 CineEurope presentation.</p><p>Ulta Beauty partnered with Marvel Studios to created a makeup collection based on the film. On July 9, 2022, Taika Waititi and Tessa Thompson appeared on Vanity Fair\'s Notes on a Scene series, analysing the ""Taste the Rainbow"" scene. The video was met with criticism for what some viewers perceived as Waititi and Thompson\'s ""mocking"" the visual effects, on the same day that multiple VFX artists who worked for Marvel had spoken out against being ""underpaid"" and ""overworked"" by the studio\'s productions.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Thor: Love and Thunder premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on June 23, 2022. The film was theatrically released in Australia on July 6, 2022, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand on July 7, and in the United States on July 8, 2022, in 4DX, RealD 3D, IMAX, ScreenX, and Dolby Cinema. It was previously set for release on November 5, 2021, but was delayed to February 18, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved up a week to February 11 once Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was rescheduled from November 2021 to March 2022, and delayed once again to May 6, 2022, in December 2020, before shifting to the July 2022 date in October 2021. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The El Capitan Theatre hosted two sensory inclusive screenings of the film in July 2022, featuring expedited check in, a ""calming"" lobby, reduced capacity, and gift bags for guests with items to aid with anxiety.</p><p>The film was not released in Malaysia, Brunei, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Variety reported that the Malaysian release did not happen because Disney refused to make cuts to the film requested by the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia. The Malaysian government confirmed that this was due to LGBT elements not being cut from the film.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Thor: Love and Thunder was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day, with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version. It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 27. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>As of October 13, 2022, Thor: Love and Thunder has grossed $343.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $417.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $760.7 million. It is the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2022. The film\'s opening weekend earned $303.3 million globally, of which IMAX contributed $23 million, making it the third-largest July debut of all-time for the format.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $140–167 million from 4,375 theatres in its opening weekend, along with a total gross of $345–420 million. The film earned $69.5 million on its first day, which included $29 million from Thursday night previews. This marked the second-highest opening day and preview night of 2022, behind fellow MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, as well as the fifth-highest opening day ever for an MCU film. Its opening weekend earned $144.2 million, which was the largest debut of the Thor franchise, the twelfth-largest for the MCU, and the third-largest for 2022, behind Multiverse of Madness ($187.4 million) and Jurassic World Dominion ($145 million). Of the $144.2 million figure, over $13.8 million came from IMAX, making it the fifth-highest July debut of all-time for the format domestically. Love and Thunder was also the sixth film in the COVID-19 pandemic to earn over 10 million theater admissions in its opening weekend. Its second weekend grossed $46.6 million, a decline of nearly 68%, representing one of the MCU\'s largest sophomore weekend drops. Deadline Hollywood attributed this to its CinemaScore grade and generally mixed reception from critics and audiences. In its third weekend the film made $22.6 million, finishing second behind newcomer Nope.</p><p>Outside of North America, Love and Thunder grossed $15.7 million from 17 markets on its opening day, surpassing the first-day overall results of Thor: Ragnarok (2017) by 39%. Its weekend gross was $159.2 million from 47 markets, making it the MCU\'s ninth-largest overseas debut ever and the third-largest for any Hollywood film released in the COVID-19 pandemic. It surpassed Ragnarok\'s opening by 19%. IMAX contributed $9.2 million to the weekend, becoming the third-largest July debut ever overseas. It also set several pandemic box office milestones in its opening weekend, marking the second-highest pandemic opening in Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines, while earning the third-highest in numerous territories, including Brazil, Italy, Thailand, Singapore and Argentina. As of July 24, 2022, the film\'s largest markets are the United Kingdom ($31.5 million), Australia ($25.5 million), Mexico ($23.2 million), South Korea ($22.3 million), and Brazil ($17.2 million).</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 64%, with an average rating of 6.4/10, based on 423 reviews. The site\'s critics consensus reads: ""In some ways, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like Ragnarok redux – but overall, it offers enough fast-paced fun to make this a worthy addition to the MCU."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported 77% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.</p><p>In early reactions to the film, Screen Rant noted that the performances from Christian Bale and Natalie Portman were praised. Owen Gleiberman of Variety said there are ""many words to describe"", stating ""comedy is all part of the package"" that made Ragnarok ""such a genuine Marvel wildflower."" Gleiberman wrote that the film ""sustains its freshness"" to the end, although it started with a ""more awkward"" first act with the Guardians of the Galaxy. He also praised Gorr\'s characterization–a ""power""–and concluded the review by saying he felt ""moved"" by the end. David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised the film for its light tone and humorous moments, writing that "" Waititi continues to brighten up the Thor movies with his own flavor of wackiness, which is as welcome here as it was grating in Jojo Rabbit."" However, he noted that the film ""is clouded by its uncertain place in the universe from the moment it starts"". Nick Allen at RogerEbert.com gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that it was ""more or less a victory lap for all that achieved with his previous Marvel film, the often hilarious, rousing, and plainly refreshing Thor: Ragnarok. And while it has too many familiar flourishes and jokes, this entertaining sequel is still a force for good, with enough visual ambition and heart in front of and behind the camera to stand on its own."" He praised Natalie Portman\'s performance that ""conveys why it\'s great to see Jane again"" and Christian Bale\'s ""striking"" role that he considered as the ""closest we\'ll get to seeing him play Pennywise the Clown, with a dash of Voldemort, but tethered to the same humility brings to his most human, humbled characters.""</p><p>Todd Gilchrist at The A.V. Club graded the film \'B\', feeling that it did "" the cheeky, sentimental tone of the nearly universally beloved Thor: Ragnarok, and propels its eponymous hero into new adventures that bring full circle a journey that started with the very first, much-less-beloved Thor back in 2011."" He praised Portman and Bale\'s performances, with the latter\'s character being considered ""the most interesting and sympathetic Marvel adversary since Michael B. Jordan\'s Killmonger in Black Panther"", and Waititi\'s ""distinctive imagery that may disturb and upset some viewers"", outpacing Sam Raimi\'s accomplishments in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly also gave a similar grade, feeling that although ""its cheerful melee of starry cameos, in-jokes, and Cliffs-Notes mythology, feels a lot like franchise fatigue, it also has frequent moments of gonzo charm, thanks largely to the Technicolor lunacy of writer-director and a cast that seems inordinately game to follow his lead.""</p><p>David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter stated, ""The movie feels weightless, flippant, instantly forgettable, sparking neither love nor thunder."" David Sims of The Atlantic felt the film delivered a ""usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there\'s not enough heft behind the flashiness."" He found it a ""hasty-feeling mess of a movie"" and ""disappointing given that it\'s directed by"", although he praised Bale and Russell Crowe\'s performances. David Fear of Rolling Stone felt the film was ""oddly unengaging; even the love and death aspects often feel like cold transmissions from distant sources."" He saw it as a mess due to the ""collision of competing tones, subplots, conceptual big swings and chaos masquerading as pathos"". Eric Francisco at Inverse found Chris Hemsworth\'s Thor in the film becoming ""meandering, left in the purgatory of a roundabout tale that makes some sense on paper but in execution fails to maintain viscosity"", feeling that Marvel ""doesn\'t know what to do with anymore."" He felt that despite ""striv for an emotional story about loss and love, the movie gets in its own way with tiresome relentless comedy, distracted plotting, and uneven tone."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, calling it ""one of the goofiest and least consequential sagas in MCU history—an allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie.""</p><p>At the London premiere Q&A, in response to the question ""How gay will the film be?"" Waititi exclaimed that it would be ""super gay""; critics and moviegoers who saw the film expressed disappointment that this statement was false and that Marvel queerbaited the audience. Jade King of The Gamer felt expectations from queer audiences for prominent ""LGBTQ+ characters and themes"" in Thor: Love and Thunder were not met, writing that ""the film\'s creators have been out there talking up the LGBTQ+ representation when it isn\'t really a massive part of the experience. it\'s time to temper your expectations and stop letting Marvel continue to queerbait us into disappointment.""</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>The film is nominated for several awards at the 47th Saturn Awards, including Best Superhero Film, Best Film Costume for Mayes C. Rubeo, and Best Film Make-up for Matteo Silvi and Adam Johansen.</p><br/><h3>Documentary special</h3><p>In February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this film, Assembled: The Making of Thor: Love and Thunder, was released on Disney+ on September 8, 2022, part of Disney+ Day.</p><br/><h3>Future</h3><p>In regards to the ""Thor will return"" tagline at the end of the film, Waititi was unaware it was added to the film, stating that it was a surprise to both him and Hemsworth. Waititi was open to returning to direct another Thor film if Hemsworth was also involved, stating the story would need to be ""something surprising and unexpected"", suggesting a low budget road trip film with no fight scenes, similar to Nebraska (2013).</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt10648342', 'title': 'Thor: Love and Thunder', 'fullTitle': 'Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)',

In July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against Disney over the simultaneous release, which was settled two months later.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov\'s Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.\r\nIn 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room\'s chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.\r\nRomanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov\'s location, and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. At the Red Room, an aerial facility, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff\'s disguise and reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage severe enough that Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her, in turn creating the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing a nerve in her nasal passage. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility\'s engines. They then lock Taskmaster in a cell.\r\nDreykov escapes as other Black Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov\'s computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane while Belova takes out Dreykov\'s aircraft, killing him. In freefall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.\r\nIn a post-credits scene set after Romanoff\'s death, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine blames her death on Barton and assigns him as Belova\'s next target.\r\nCast\r\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:An Avenger, highly trained former-KGB assassin and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Johansson said she was ""going out on a high note"" and was proud of the film, feeling that her work portraying Romanoff was now complete. She described the film as an opportunity to show the character as ""a woman who has come into her own and is making independent and active choices for herself"", while being in a dark place with no one to call, and felt the character\'s vulnerability set her apart from the other Avengers. Director Cate Shortland watched all of Romanoff\'s MCU appearances consecutively in preparation for the film, and chose to set the story where Romanoff is alone and not ""in relation to anyone else"". Shortland said Romanoff\'s ambiguous psychological journey was the center of the story. Ever Anderson portrays a young Natasha Romanoff. Anderson, who speaks Russian, felt her background in taekwondo and gymnastics training was helpful for the role.\r\nFlorence Pugh as Yelena Belova / Black Widow:A sister to Romanoff who was trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow. Johansson said Belova was an early inclusion in the film who could stand on her own in comparison to Romanoff. Pugh said there was a ""generational difference"" between the two, and described Belova as ""unapologetic, and confident in herself, and curious ... and emotionally brave"". Pugh admired Belova\'s bluntness and determination, and noted that the character is a skilled fighter but does not know how to live a normal life.: 4 Shortland said that Romanoff would be ""handing the baton"" in the film, and Pugh looked to Johansson for guidance during filming on meeting the demands of making Marvel films. Johansson wanted to avoid an antagonistic dynamic between the two characters, instead having a sister-like but contentious relationship that Pugh characterized as ""a sister story that really hones in on grief, on pain, on abuse, on being a victim—and living with being a victim"". Violet McGraw portrays a young Yelena Belova.\r\nDavid Harbour as Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian:The Russian super-soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Romanoff and Belova. Harbour said Shostakov was not heroic or noble, and was both comically and tragically flawed. Shostakov claims that he fought Captain America in the 1980s, and screenwriter Eric Pearson felt the character believed that this was true despite it being impossible. For Harbour\'s portrayal, he and Shortland discussed Ricky Gervais\' performance in The Office and Philip Seymour Hoffman\'s in The Savages (2007), ""comedy that comes out of real domestic need"".: 62 Harbour had already grown his facial hair for the fourth season of Stranger Things, and he gained weight for the role to be 280 pounds (127 kg). He then lost 60 pounds (27 kg) over the course of filming to portray a younger version of the character for the film\'s opening flashback sequence.\r\nO-T Fagbenle as Rick Mason:An ally from Romanoff\'s S.H.I.E.L.D. past who is romantically interested in her. Fagbenle described Mason as a ""finder for people who aren\'t so affiliated with armies"" who assists Romanoff in that manner. On why a romance between Mason and Romanoff is not explored in the film, Fagbenle said the film was ""bigger than that"" and their relationship was part of Romanoff\'s larger family instead. Aside from Pearson\'s script, Fagbenle developed Mason\'s backstory with Shortland and Johansson. As Taskmaster\'s identity was kept secret, many people assumed Mason would secretly take up the mantle, which Fagbenle had to deny even to his personal trainer. The film\'s final scene, in which Mason provides Romanoff with a Quinjet, was added as part of reshoots in early 2020 after test audiences liked seeing Romanoff and Mason together.\r\nOlga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster:Dreykov\'s daughter who completes missions for the Red Room. She has photographic reflexes that allow her to mimic opponents\' fighting styles,: 4 and uses techniques from superheroes such as Iron Man, Captain America, the Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, and Black Panther. Several body doubles were required to portray the character\'s various skills. Kurylenko said much of Antonia\'s pain is internal, and described her relationship with Dreykov as abusive since Dreykov uses her ""as a tool has her do whatever he wants"". Taskmaster is revealed to be Antonia in the film instead of the comic book counterpart Tony Masters since Masters is a mercenary that did not fit into the film\'s story and it was more natural to Pearson to tie Taskmaster into a ""loose end from Natasha\'s past"". Ryan Kiera Armstrong portrays a young Antonia Dreykov.\r\nWilliam Hurt as Thaddeus Ross: The United States Secretary of State and a former U.S. Army general.\r\nRay Winstone as Dreykov:A Russian general and the head of the Red Room.: 62: 9 Pearson felt the film needed a villain that could fit within its timeframe undetected so as to avoid contradicting the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). He described Dreykov as a coward who is ""puppeteering things"" from the shadows and does not care about hurting others.\r\nRachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff / Black Widow:A seasoned spy trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow and a mother-figure to Romanoff and Belova who is now one of the Red Room\'s lead scientists.: 4 Compared to Vostokoff\'s comic book counterpart, who becomes the supervillain Iron Maiden, Weisz felt the film\'s version was more ambiguous and layered, with a deadpan personality and no sense of humor which Weisz found amusing. Weisz was given a tailored Black Widow suit for the film which she called an ""iconic"" piece of clothing that was ""a lot to live up to"". Weisz reworked Vostokoff\'s portrayal to be more affectionate towards Shostakov, rather than dismissive.\r\nAdditionally, Liani Samuel, Michelle Lee, and Nanna Blondell appear as Red Room assassins Lerato, Oksana, and Ingrid, respectively, while Jade Xu portrays another Black Widow, later identified as Helen in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). Olivier Richters portrays Ursa Major, a fellow inmate of Shostakov\'s. The film\'s post-credits scene sees Julia Louis-Dreyfus reprising her role as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) in an uncredited cameo appearance. Jeremy Renner reprises his MCU role as Clint Barton in an uncredited voice-only cameo.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\n""What I tried to do was use the backdrop of the splintered Soviet Empire—a lawless insane asylum with 400-some odd nuclear missile silos. It was all about loose nukes, and I felt it was very timely and very cool. Unfortunately, as I was coming up on the final draft, a number of female vigilante movies came out. We had Tomb Raider and Kill Bill, which were the ones that worked, but then we had BloodRayne and Ultraviolet and Æon Flux. Æon Flux didn\'t open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, \'We don\'t think it\'s time to do this movie.\'""\r\n—David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward\r\nIn February 2004, Lionsgate acquired the film rights for Black Widow, and in April announced David Hayter as writer and director of the film, with Marvel Studios\' Avi Arad producing. By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter ""never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously"". This left Hayter ""heartbroken"", but he hoped the film would be made ""some day"".\r\nMarvel entered early talks with Emily Blunt to play Black Widow in Iron Man 2 (2010) in January 2009, but she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver\'s Travels (2010). In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films. In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of Iron Man 2, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel\'s focus was on The Avengers (2012). Johansson reprised her role in that film, as well as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). After the release of Age of Ultron, Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the ""demand of the character"", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience\'s ""great reaction"" to the character and her performance.\r\nIn February 2014, Feige said that after exploring Black Widow\'s past in Age of Ultron, he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it, including a ""pretty in depth"" treatment by Nicole Perlman, who co-wrote Marvel\'s Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience. That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel, and the following month, director Neil Marshall said that he ""would love to do a Black Widow film"", saying he felt the character was ""really interesting she doesn\'t have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-K.G.B. assassin, I find that really fascinating"". In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the character\'s different layers as depicted in her previous appearances. However, she felt that the character was being ""used well in this part of the universe"" at that time. While promoting Civil War the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential Black Widow film would be four or five years away. He added that Marvel was ""creatively and emotionally"" committed to making a Black Widow film eventually.\r\nJoss Whedon, the director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, said in July 2016 that he was open to directing a Black Widow film, feeling he could make ""a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, \'John le Carré on crack\' sort of thing."" In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, ""you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There\'s all kinds of stuff that you could do with it."" She did caution she may not want to ""wear a skin-tight catsuit"" for much longer. The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film ""amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story."" Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the best time to move forward with the project would be at the beginning of the ""latest phase"" of the MCU in 2020.\r\nFeige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a solo film in October 2017, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao. Gao\'s pitch for the film was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then attends a high school reunion 20 years later ""and has to deal with the fallout of this fake identity where she betrayed all these people in high school"". It also heavily featured She-Hulk, with Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum feeling Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow, rather than focusing on Black Widow. Gao would later become the head writer for the TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022). Following the #MeToo movement, Johansson wanted the film to comment on the movement which saw women supporting each other and ""coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side"". Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017. Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.\r\nMarvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises. By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an ""extremely thorough"" search, including Deniz Gamze Ergüven, Chloé Zhao—who went on to direct Marvel\'s Eternals (2021)—Amma Asante, and Lynn Shelton. Lucrecia Martel was also approached, but was discouraged when told she would not have to ""worry about the action scenes"". She also felt the music and visual effects of Marvel films were ""horrible"". In the following months, a shortlist of 49 directors was made before the top choices of Cate Shortland, Asante, and Maggie Betts met with Feige and Johansson in June. Mélanie Laurent and Kimberly Peirce were also in the ""next-to-final mix"". Johansson was a fan of Shortland\'s previous female-starring film Lore (2012), and was the one who approached her about directing the film;: 1 Shortland was hired in July. Johansson said Black Widow became ""more of a reality"" during the filming of Infinity War and she was also aware of the character\'s death in Endgame. Knowing this helped inform when Black Widow would take place in the MCU timeline. Johansson also believed there was ""no pressing urgency"" to make the film, and that making it when it was, rather than years earlier, allowed the film to be ""about real stuff"".\r\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the ""low-seven figure salary"" that she earned for starring in The Avengers. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the third films in their MCU franchises—Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok (2017), respectively, and also earned the same amount for co-starring in Infinity War and Endgame. Despite The Hollywood Reporter claiming the salaries were confirmed by ""multiple knowledgeable sources"" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers, saying that they ""never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms."" The Walt Disney Company later stated that Johansson earned $20 million by the end of July 2021 for her work on the film. Johansson also served as an executive producer on the film.\r\nPre-production\r\nIn February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script, and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is ""morally opposite"" to Romanoff, later revealed to be Yelena Belova. Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses, including Saoirse Ronan, in early 2019. The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019). Devin Grayson and J. G. Jones, who co-created Belova, had expected to receive $25,000 for her appearance in the film due to a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators\' payments. In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, and O-T Fagbenle. Shortland said the film would not be an origin story despite being a prequel to Infinity War and Endgame, as Feige felt that would be expected of a prequel and decided to move in the ""opposite direction"" of that idea. Feige likened the film to the television series Better Call Saul, which is a prequel to the series Breaking Bad, because it was ""a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... it informs you about so many things you didn\'t know about before"". Shortland acknowledged Romanoff\'s death in Endgame and the fact that some fans were upset she did not receive a funeral in that film, but said the character was private and did not know many people so she would not have wanted a funeral. However, Black Widow allowed the ending ""to be the grief the individuals felt, rather than a big public outpouring"".\r\nEric Pearson is credited as the screenwriter for Black Widow, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit. The film is mostly set between the main plot of Captain America: Civil War and that film\'s final scene, in which the Avengers escape from prison. Johansson and Feige felt setting the film after Civil War was ""the best place to start"" because it is the first time that Romanoff is on her own and not tied to a larger organization. A version of the script from before Pearson joined had included a scene from Civil War between Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.\'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film, but Shortland and Feige decided against adding Stark or any other heroes to the film in order for Romanoff to stand on her own, and it was determined that the scene did not add anything new. The story sees Romanoff confronting Dreykov, the head of the Red Room, with Johansson explaining that she is running away from that trauma of her past, only for her sister, Belova, to force her to ""come to terms with that"" and face it in the film. Johansson added that these ideas were relevant to real-world events in the time the film was being made, and she was grateful to have the film to comment on these. The film begins with an opening credits sequence designed by Perception, featuring flashbacks to the Red Room and pictures of Dreykov, with Feige explaining that Shortland wanted to tell the story of what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film. A scene at the end of the film in which Thaddeus Ross pursues Romanoff was deliberately left unresolved, as Shortland wanted to leave the audience ""on a high"" questioning how Romanoff escapes rather than exhaust them with another fight.\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway. Shortland wanted the film to have ""peril at its heart"" and be ""really emotional but also story-driven"". She took inspiration from films like How to Train Your Dragon (2010),: 63 No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Shortland also looked at combat films and ones with armies and militia, allowing her to image females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow. She referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film\'s fights to resemble ""real fights"" rather than wrestling matches. Early reports suggested that Rob Hardy would be the film\'s cinematographer, but he left the production before filming began. Gabriel Beristain served as cinematographer instead, having previously done so for the Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013) as well as the television series Agent Carter.: 3 Beristain was initially not credited in the film\'s trailers as pointed out by Jeff Sneider of Collider, who wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting the cinematographer at that point. Sneider felt Beristain would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film\'s release, and he was confirmed in the role in the film\'s press advance.: 3 Beristein later confirmed he came as production had already began and moved to London, opting to leave a television directing job so he could be the main cinematographer in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film for the first time, having contributed additional photography for Iron Man and six other films. Shortland preferred to ""be separate to the technical equipment"" and also prioritize natural lighting, which provided a challenge in having to match the light of the location shoots in the additional photography filmed in Los Angeles. The naturalistic approach was also reflected in preferring lighting from outside, or lights with strong diffusion in interior scenes for the same effect. An anamorphic format was chosen to highlight the expansive movements and landscapes, ""characters transitioning from the background to the foreground, crossing the screen in an elegant, majestic way"", and filming those was helped by using an extension system that split the camera\'s image sensor from its body.\r\nThe production moved to Pinewood Studios in London in early June, with Ray Winstone joining the cast later that month. Shooting took place in mid-July at Hankley Common in Surrey, England, under the working title Blue Bayou. The site was made to look like a Russian farmstead, with added helicopter crash sites. The Thursley Parish Council objected to this filming, as it had occurred while Marvel Studios\' application to use the site was still pending. The production planned to revisit the site in late August 2019 for further filming. Black Widow was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con later in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members. In August, bodybuilder Olivier Richters announced that he had been cast in the film, and crew undertook scanning and textured photography at the Well-Safe Guardian oil rig in the North Sea as a reference for visual effects.\r\n13 BMW X3s were used to create the car chase sequence involving Romanoff and Belova in Budapest, with the crew often switching off the electronic stability control and safety assistance functions to fit with the script, as well as swapping the X3\'s electronic parking brake for a hydraulically actuated one. Second unit director Darrin Prescott explained that the crew would often ""replace the engine or tear the entire body off the car and rebuild it from scratch"". The sequence\'s plot and locations were adjusted to help Prescott create the spontaneous, original stunts that he wanted.\r\nA wrap party for the film was held at the end of September, before production moved to Macon, Georgia for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including Terminal Station, were dressed to portray Albany, New York. Set photos in October revealed that William Hurt would appear in the film, reprising his MCU role as Thaddeus Ross. Filming also took place in Atlanta, Budapest, Rome, Georgia, and Morocco. The production filmed for 87 days,: 3 and officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.\r\nPost-production\r\nMatthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors.: 3 A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to ""how sexy is she\'s in control"" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene\'s ""male gaze"". In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early April, Disney announced that Black Widow would be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted to accommodate this. In September 2020, Disney pushed the release back again to May 7, 2021, followed by a third shift in March 2021 to July 9, 2021.\r\nIn April 2021, following Julia Louis-Dreyfus\'s appearance as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Studios television series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Louis-Dreyfus had been expected to first appear in Black Widow before its delays pushed the film\'s release to after the series\' premiere on Disney+. Feige later confirmed this, with Black Widow\'s post-credits scene originally intended to be the introduction to the character but now acting as a reference to her appearance in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. He said this was the only change to Marvel\'s Phase Four plans that was forced by the pandemic. The post-credits scene was added after Hawkeye showrunner Jonathan Igla expressed interest in having Yelena Belova in his show, and Eric Pearson was asked to write it without knowing the character revealed as her target. Shortland said in May that the film had been completed a year prior and had not been altered despite the release delays. The release of the film revealed that Olga Kurylenko portrays Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster in the film; Kurylenko\'s involvement was excluded from the film\'s marketing.\r\nVisual effect vendors included Cinesite, Digital Domain, Industrial Light & Magic, Mammal Studios, SSVFX, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Wētā FX. Digital Domain completed approximately 320 visual effects shots for the film, with work split between its offices in Los Angeles, Montreal and Vancouver, and was primarily responsible for the final battle sequence and creating the Red Room, an airborne fortress hidden in the clouds. The team took inspiration from architecture in the Soviet-era, in addition to incorporating brutalist architecture, and had to plan major aspects of the sequence, such as the lighting, atmosphere, and the altitude. A combination of practical and visual effects were used to create the sequence. Actors and stunt performers were filmed in a wind tunnel against bluescreens while being held aloft using wires and mechanical arms. The surrounding environment was created entirely with computer graphics. Dave Hodgins, the Digital Domain VFX supervisor, said ""Rendering one cloud is easy, but rendering 100 clouds – along with dozens of pieces of big and small debris – is very complex, to say the least."" The visual effects team used GPU rendering to create the bulk of the wreckage and debris, which allowed them to do more in a shorter period of time. The falling debris was created from reference footage of other chunks of debris and additional premade assets, which allowed them to capture a ""diorama of stuff falling in each shot"". Larger pieces were tracked to more recognizable shapes, while a lot of pieces were inserted to make the scene look ""aesthetically pleasing"".\r\nIndustrial Light & Magic completed approximately 800 VFX shots for the film, and worked on the opening airplane escape scene, the Budapest apartment fight along with its subsequent motorcycle and car chase, and the Widows fighting Romanoff in Dreykov\'s room. The opening airplane escape scene was created with half of an airplane rig on a biscuit driving platform with hydraulics. To adjust the lighting of the scene, the footage filmed in Atlanta and the dirt path along the cornfield was taken to LED screens, while close-up shots of David Harbour\'s Shostakov hanging off the plane were captured onstage. Footage of practical cars were also filmed using a rig which launched them, while additional CGI cars were also inserted into the sequence. To create the Budapest scenes, ILM collaborated closely with the second unit director Darren Prescott. The combat scene in the kitchen was filmed using a wire rig, while both Johansson and Pugh performed their movements against the stunt doubles for the other sister to aid in the face replacements for stunt doubles in post. Their chase across the rooftops was also a combination of practical and visual effects. Scenes involving smokestacks were created using virtual actors, while the courtyard was a digitally recreated environment. The car chase scene in Budapest features a practical tank driven by Taskmaster created by Paul Corbould, the special effects supervisor. Digital cars were also added to the scene to make it appear more dangerous and for better interaction with the tank. While most components of the scene was filmed practically using stunt doubles, some parts, such as the scene where the door is ripped, was created digitally. For the fight scene in Dreykov\'s office, the team used a projector onset to adjust the lighting on the Widow\'s bodies. They had to change the position to fix the lighting, as the screens displayed graphics and to adjust to the choreography of the sequence.\r\nMusic\r\nAlexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020. Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020. A cover of Nirvana\'s ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Think Up Anger, featuring Malia J, is used in the opening credits sequence, and was suggested by Perception. ""American Pie"" by Don McLean and ""Cheap Thrills"" by Sia are also featured in the film. Balfe\'s score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on July 9, 2021.\r\nMarketing\r\nThe film was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, with Feige, Shortland, and cast members promoting it and introducing footage from the first 30 days of production. Some of that footage was included in a teaser trailer for the film released in December, with several commentators highlighting its spy thriller tone, and calling the film ""long awaited"" or ""highly anticipated"" by fans. Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue said finally seeing a trailer for the film was ""surprisingly emotional"", and felt that setting it between Civil War and Infinity War would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film after earlier MCU films had depicted her in a supporting role to the male Avengers. Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the trailer\'s story and tone to the films Atomic Blonde (2017), Red Sparrow (2018), and Anna (2019), but felt Black Widow had a commercial advantage over those films since it stars a familiar character. Mendelson thought this familiarity could outweigh the teaser\'s focus on ""family melodrama"" over superheroics, which he compared to Marvel\'s Thor (2011). The Hollywood Reporter\'s Richard Newby found noticeable differences between Shortland\'s shot composition and cinematography in the trailer compared to the styles of Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers, all directors who helped define Black Widow in previous MCU films. What was intended to be the final trailer for the film debuted in March 2020. Nicole Carpenter of Polygon said it was the most in-depth look at the film yet, with Josh Weiss of Syfy Wire enjoying its quieter moments in addition to the expected action sequences. Mendelson found the trailer to be an improvement over the teaser, attributing this to its theme of ""found families (the Avengers), forced families () and actual family"" portrayed by Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz.\r\nDisney\'s president of marketing Asad Ayaz said that after Black Widow was delayed from its original May 2020 release date, the marketing team paused their campaign for the film. Once they began working towards a new release date in 2021, they were able to use character looks and story points that they had not revealed in the initial campaign to build a new approach to the film. Ayaz explained that they did not want it to feel like they had returned to the same marketing campaign, which focused on the Black Widow symbol and her black costume. The marketing team differentiated the new campaign by featuring the character\'s white costume from the film instead, and by focusing on her legacy as an Avenger. The campaign featured 30 brands, including co-branded opportunities with GEICO, Ziploc, BMW, and Synchrony Bank. Additional custom partnerships occurred with Fandango, YouTube, Roku, TikTok, Amazon, a Twitter E3 gaming sponsorship, and announcements, posters, and collectibles for the various premium theater experiences such as IMAX.\r\nIn September 2020, Barbie released two Black Widow dolls featuring the black and white outfits worn by Romanoff in the film. Marvel released another trailer for the film in April 2021, which Austen Goslin at Polygon felt was a new ""final"" trailer for the film\'s new release date. He said it only had a few new scenes in it but provided the best look yet at Taskmaster. Goslin highlighted the Russian-inspired version of The Avengers theme music used at the end of the trailer. Germain Lussier of io9 also highlighted the use of The Avengers theme, feeling that the music combined with footage from previous MCU films as well as flashback moments of Natasha and her family made the trailer feel more epic than the previous final trailer. Lussier said it was a trailer that ""gets you excited for the return"" of MCU films. Ethan Anderton of /Film said the ""epic"" free-falling fight with Taskmaster showcased in the trailer ""looks like a sequence unlike any other"" in the MCU. The trailer received over 70 million views in its first 24 hours. On July 5, Moneymaker: Behind the Black Widow, a half-hour documentary special centered on Johansson\'s stunt double Heidi Moneymaker, premiered on ESPN+ as part of ESPN\'s E60 series. The special was directed by Martin Khodabakhshian and narrated by Johansson. A subsequent, eight-minute version of the special aired on ESPN\'s Outside the Lines on July 10. An episode of the series Marvel Studios: Legends was released on July 7, exploring Black Widow using footage from her previous MCU appearances.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical and Premier Access\r\nBlack Widow premiered on June 29, 2021, at various red carpet fan events in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and New York City. It screened at the Taormina Film Fest on July 3, and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access for US$30. It premiered in 46 territories over the course of its first weekend. In the U.S. it opened in 4,100 theaters, with 375 in IMAX, over 800 in premium large format, 1,500 in 3D, and 275 in specialty D-Box, 4DX, and ScreenX theaters. In IMAX screenings, approximately 22 minutes of the film appeared in IMAX\'s expanded aspect ratio. Black Widow is the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU. Release dates for China, Taiwan, India, parts of Australia, and other Southeast Asia and Latin America markets were not set by the film\'s opening weekend, and by mid-September 2021, the film was not expected to be released theatrically in China.\r\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020. In early March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic had caused the closure of theaters in many countries, the release date for the film No Time to Die was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other major films like Black Widow to be postponed as well. Deadline Hollywood reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that Black Widow would take the November release date of Marvel\'s Eternals, with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney said that it still intended to release Black Widow in May 2020. After a trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at Forbes highlighted how the trailer\'s existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was ""the logical choice at this juncture"", feeling it was the ideal release date for the film and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect its performance in the U.S. A week later, theaters across the U.S. were closed due to the pandemic and gatherings larger than 50 people were discouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Disney removed the film from its May release date. Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly at Variety questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by the delay than other franchises due to its interconnected nature, though a Marvel Studios source told them that changing the film\'s release date would not affect the MCU timeline. The pair speculated that this was due to the film being a prequel set earlier in the timeline than other Phase Four films. In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate due to the pandemic, giving Eternals\' November 6, 2020, release date to Black Widow and shifting all of its other Phase Four films back in the release schedule to accommodate this.\r\nAnthony D\'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood reported in September 2020 that Disney was considering rescheduling Black Widow again, with Variety also reporting this and attributing it to the low box office returns for Disney\'s Mulan in China and Warner Bros.\' Tenet in North America. Later that month, Disney pushed back the release to May 7, 2021, rescheduling Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) as a result. In January 2021, Feige said he still expected Black Widow to debut in theaters, but Variety reported that Disney was considering releasing the film on its streaming service Disney+. There was also potential to delay the film\'s release again if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic did not improve leading up to the planned May 2021 release, or to release the film concurrently in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access as was done with Disney\'s Raya and the Last Dragon (2021). Variety felt it would be ""insurmountably more challenging"" for Black Widow to become profitable if it did not have a traditional theatrical release. In early February, Disney CEO Bob Chapek reaffirmed that Black Widow was intended to be solely released in theaters, but Disney was cognizant of theaters reopening, particularly in large cities such as New York and Los Angeles, as well as consumer desire to return to theaters. According to Variety, Feige was opposed to a hybrid release for the film. If the film was delayed again, the film distribution industry believed Disney would move it to July 9, 2021, which at that point was the release date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The next month, Chapek reiterated that Disney planned to release Black Widow in theaters on May 7, while Deadline Hollywood again noted that delaying the film, releasing it simultaneously on Disney+, or releasing it in theaters for a short time before making it available on Disney+ were all still possibilities. Chapek soon stated that Disney was remaining flexible as they gauged consumer behavior, and they would make a final decision on releasing the film at the ""last minute"".\r\nIn late March, Disney moved the film\'s release date to July 9, 2021, and announced that it would release simultaneously on Disney+ with Premier Access. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was delayed again as a result. Kareem Daniel, the chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, said the simultaneous release gave fans options to see the film while serving the ""evolving preferences of audiences"". Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge opined that Disney had to move forward with a simultaneous release for the film because they could not afford to delay Marvel\'s Phase Four television series. He explained that those series were some of the few ""high-profile, must-watch shows"" on Disney+, and once they began releasing with WandaVision in January 2021 there was only so much time that the films could be delayed before the interconnected nature of Marvel\'s storytelling began causing issues. For instance, the series Hawkeye was expected to release later in 2021 and contain spoilers for Black Widow, so the film needed to be released before then. Gartenberg described Disney and Marvel as being victims of their own success, but felt the potential revenue loss from the simultaneous release could lead to long-term positives such as fans who otherwise would not have watched Marvel\'s series potentially discovering them when signing up to Disney+ to watch Black Widow.\r\nLawsuit\r\nIn July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging that the simultaneous release of Black Widow on Disney+ breached a stipulation in her contract that the film receive an exclusive theatrical release. The suit stated that the simultaneous release exempted Disney from paying ""very large box office bonuses"" that Johansson would have reportedly been entitled to. According to The Wall Street Journal, Johansson had been concerned about the possibility of the film being released on Disney+ since prior to the release of Avengers: Endgame. Vulture contributor Chris Lee opined that not having any planned appearances in future MCU projects would have emboldened Johansson to file the lawsuit. Disney issued a statement in response, saying the suit was meritless and calling it a ""callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."" Additionally, the company claimed that they had fully complied with Johansson\'s contract and that the Disney+ Premier Access release of the film had ""significantly enhanced ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.""\r\nBryan Lourd, Johansson\'s agent and co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), criticized Disney\'s response by arguing that the company had ""shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic"" and accusing them of ""leaving artistic and financial partners"" out of their streaming profits, with CAA criticizing Disney\'s disclosure of Johansson\'s $20 million earnings as ""an attempt to weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of."" The advocacy organizations Women in Film, ReFrame, and Time\'s Up also released a joint statement criticizing Disney\'s response, calling it a ""gendered character attack"" and saying they ""stand firmly against Disney\'s recent statement which attempts to characterize Johansson as insensitive or selfish for defending her contractual business rights"". TheWrap reported that Johansson was shocked by the tone of Disney\'s response, while Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger was allegedly mortified by the lawsuit. Feige was reportedly angered and embarrassed by Disney\'s handling of the situation, and wanted the company to make it right with Johansson. SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris also criticized Disney\'s response, saying they ""should be ashamed of themselves for resorting to tired tactics such as gender-shaming and bullying"". In response to these criticisms, Disney attorney Daniel Petrocelli called the suit a ""highly orchestrated campaign to achieve an outcome that is not obtainable in a lawsuit"".\r\nEriq Gardner at The Hollywood Reporter believed Johansson\'s case was potentially weak since disputes of this kind usually take place in arbitration, and that she had been forced into presenting a claim of tortious interference rather than a standard contract breach due to a clause in her contract. Gardner added that Johansson\'s complaint of Disney not waiting a few months for the market to recover from the impact of the pandemic was countered by the fact that Disney had already delayed the film\'s release by a year, since Disney would not want to wait too long after Avengers: Endgame to release Black Widow when the MCU was already moving on. This was especially true since the film introduces important new characters to the franchise such as Yelena Belova. Screen Daily editor Matt Mueller told BBC News that he believed the case would be resolved between Disney and Johansson before reaching court, and expressed surprise that Disney had let it get to this stage, given Warner Bros. had made agreements with stars for simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max of titles like Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). Mueller also believed the case would prompt other major Hollywood studios with streaming services to look at what ""contractual steps"" they would need to prevent further legal action like this. Variety reported in July 2021 that the case had prompted other Disney actors to consider similar litigations.\r\nIn August, Disney filed a motion to move the lawsuit to arbitration, citing that Black Widow outgrossed other MCU films on its opening weekend with an ""impressive pandemic-era showing"". Johansson\'s attorney John Berlinski criticized this move as an attempt by Disney to ""hide its misconduct in a confidential arbitration"", while describing their previous responses as misogynistic. A month later, the suit was settled under undisclosed terms, though Deadline Hollywood reported that Johansson would receive over $40 million from Disney. The settlement came after Disney chose to give theatrical-only releases to subsequent 2021 films following the box office success of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Free Guy (2021), which both also received exclusive theatrical windows when initially released. In November 2021, Johansson said in regards to the lawsuit that she felt ""very fortunate that nobody will have to go through what I went through"" and thought the case had made ""a positive impact in the industry and hopefully for artists and creatives\' lives and livelihood.""\r\nHome media\r\nBlack Widow was released in the U.S. on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 10, 2021, and was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 14. Deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes were included. The film was made available to all Disney+ subscribers for streaming starting October 6. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nBlack Widow grossed $183.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $196.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $379.8 million. The film\'s opening weekend earned $226.2 million globally, which included $80.4 million domestic box office, $78.8 million international box office, and $67 million in Disney+ Premier Access global revenue. The opening weekend gross was within or exceeded various pre-release projections. In June 2021, Fandango reported that the film had the most ticket presales in 2021, and surpassed other MCU films like Doctor Strange (2016) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).\r\nBlack Widow earned $39.5 million on its opening day, including $13.2 million from Thursday night previews, which was the best preview night and opening day since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Its total weekend gross was $80.4 million, making it the top film of the weekend. This was the largest box office opening since the COVID-19 pandemic began, surpassing F9\'s opening ($70 million), and the largest opening weekend since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The domestic gross was within some of the pre-release projections for the film, though was considered under some industry projections made during the weekend after examining its opening night and preview grosses; Deadline Hollywood attributed some of this to the film\'s availability on Disney+ with Premier Access. When the $80.4 million theatrical gross was combined with the domestic Premier Access revenue of $55 million, totaling over $135.4 million for its opening weekend, Disney noted Black Widow was the only film to surpass $100 million in domestic consumer spend on opening weekend since the start of the pandemic, and marked the third largest opening ever for an MCU origin film, behind Black Panther ($202 million) and Captain Marvel ($153.4 million). Following its opening weekend, Black Widow posted the largest non-holiday Monday ($7.16 million) and Tuesday ($7.6 million) gross in the pandemic. The film passed $100 million in domestic box office six days after release, making it the fastest to do so in the pandemic.\r\nIn its second weekend, the film grossed $25.8 million, finishing second behind Space Jam: A New Legacy. Its 67% drop marked the largest sophomore week decline for an MCU film, passing Ant-Man and the Wasp (62%). Box office analysts attributed Black Widow\'s second-week decline to its Disney+ Premier Access release, as well as widely reported piracies of the film online. In its third weekend, the film earned a further $11.6 million and became the fastest film to reach $150 million in total domestic box office gross in the pandemic. Black Widow was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States.\r\nOutside of North America, Black Widow earned $78.8 million in its opening weekend, from 46 markets. It was the number one film in nearly all of these markets, including the markets in the Asia Pacific region where it opened, excluding Japan, where it was third, and all markets in the Latin America region. Black Widow was the top pandemic opening weekend in 15 European markets. IMAX accounted for $4.8 million of the weekend gross, from 59 countries, 11 of which set opening weekend records for the pandemic. In Korea, the film\'s opening day was the second-best of 2021, with $3.3 million, and Hong Kong had the best opening of the pandemic, with $3.2 million. The film had the largest opening day of the pandemic in Austria, the Czech Republic, Qatar, and Slovakia, while in Saudi Arabia, the film earned the highest opening day for a Disney release ever. It was the number one film on opening day in many other markets. As of October 20, 2021, the top markets are Korea ($26.3 million), the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), and France ($15.1 million).\r\nStreaming viewership\r\nWith Disney+ Premier Access, Black Widow earned $67 million worldwide in its opening weekend; it marked the first film Disney revealed Premier Access revenue for, with the revenue skewing heavily towards the United States with $55 million. Viewer tracking application Samba TV, which measures at least five minutes of viewership on smart televisions in over 3 million U.S. households, reported that 1.1 million households watched the film in its opening weekend. Deadline Hollywood noted that this viewership translated to about $33 million in revenue for Disney, considering the U.S.$29.99 price of Premier Access, which lined up with the announced worldwide revenue. The site also stated that Disney was receiving about 85% of the Disney+ Premier revenue, sharing the rest with platform providers such as Amazon Firestick and Apple TV+.\r\nThe following weekend, Deadline reported that Black Widow had become the most-pirated film of the past week, while some industry sources believed it had become the most-pirated film of the pandemic. Samba TV later updated the film\'s Disney+ Premier Access viewership, reporting that the film had been streamed over 2 million times in the U.S. over its first 10 days of release, which resulted in around $60 million in overall domestic revenue from Disney+. Samba TV also reported updates to 10-day viewership in the United Kingdom (258,000), Germany (116,000), and Australia (47,000). In October, Samba TV reported that over 1.1 million U.S. households had watched Black Widow in the first five days of its availability to all subscribers on Disney+. They also reported viewership in the United Kingdom (190,000) and Germany (96,000) during that same time frame. As of August 15, 2021, Black Widow has earned $125 million through streaming and digital downloads. In its first 30 days, the film was watched in over 2.8 million U.S. households. Deadline Hollywood also reported the film had been pirated over 20 million times, resulting in at least $600 million in lost revenue for Disney. In January 2022, tech firm Akami reported that Black Widow was the third-most pirated film of 2021.\r\nCritical response\r\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 6.9/10, based on 449 reviews. The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""Black Widow\'s deeper themes are drowned out in all the action, but it remains a solidly entertaining standalone adventure that\'s rounded out by a stellar supporting cast."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 88% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.\r\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety initially feared Black Widow would be two hours of Johansson being ""a kick-ass fighter in sleek leather with a few signature jackknife moves"" but instead found the film to be ""much more interesting and absorbing"" and ""features just enough kinetic combat to give a mainstream audience that getting-your-money\'s-worth feeling, but from the opening credits, most of it has a gritty, deliberate, zap-free tone that is strikingly — and intentionally — earthbound for a superhero fantasy."" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised Pugh\'s performance as ""finding just the right shades of strength and vulnerability"" and as ""the film\'s MVP"".\r\nWriting for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Black Widow a ""high-octane espionage thriller"" that "" away from the superhero template."" Rooney added the film was ""a stellar vehicle"" for Johansson and praised the supporting cast. Joshua Rivera of Polygon wrote ""Black Widow has a focus that\'s refreshing to the MCU, allowing it a sense of style and fun that\'s genuinely enjoyable once you get over the strangeness of the film\'s continuity in the MCU"", although he said the film feels ""hollow"" and like an ""apology"" after the death of Romanoff in Avengers: Endgame. IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn gave the film a B grade, writing, ""Like the welcoming breeziness of Spider-Man: Homecoming, the saga of Natasha and Yelena doesn\'t try to rope in the fate of the known universe to make its operation worthwhile. The relatively low stakes help to foreground their moody dynamic, at least whenever the hand-to-hand combat doesn\'t get there first. Fortunately, the movie delivers on that front, most notably during a brawl between Black Widow and the robotic killer known as Taskmaster who mirrors her every move. If this is the last time we get to see Johansson mete out justice to her assailants with gymnastic velocity, it\'s an apt send-off.""\r\nPete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood wrote that Johansson ""goes out with all guns blazing as this first film in Phase 4 of the MCU does not stint one bit on the action,"" with a film that ""more importantly focuses on the human being behind the shield of a superhero."" Hammond felt that the opening sequence revealing Romanoff\'s family construct are actually Russian spies was reminiscent of The Americans, while he praised the chemistry between Johansson and Pugh, ""with Natasha\'s awkward shyness counterpunched by the lively and cynical Yelena."" Of the performances, Hammond said: ""Johansson is again a great presence in the role, showing expert action and acting chops throughout, while Pugh is clearly ready to lead her own franchise after this MCU debut. Weisz is simply such a good actor she can even make some of the more ridiculous dialogue land, and Harbour, tatted to the hilt, is clearly having a blast overplaying every moment of a character designed to think only about himself."" Hammond also said ""having Winstone in this picture lifts it several notches, and he is deliciously fun and scarily authentic as the villain of the piece.""\r\nWriting for BBC Culture, Caryn James gave the film four out of five stars, opining that the film was ""the least Avenger-like movie in the so far"", and that ""after all this time a tweak in the formula is a good thing."" James, like Hammond, noted the film\'s opening sequence as reminiscent of The Americans, while she praised Pugh\'s performance, calling Belova ""the most vibrant person in the film, more lived-in than most action-movie characters."" James, however, also noted the film\'s presentation of ""the perfect metaphor for Russia v the West"" with ""the Russians hav developed a synthetic formula that can suppress free will"" with ""nothing deep or heavy about the film\'s treatment of that idea"". James also felt that Romanoff was ""the least interesting character"" amongst her family, being ""an odd fit for the sly family movie unfolding around her"", and felt the film had a ""typically Avengers"" ending with ""an overwrought, too-long action scene that plays like a festival of stunt doubles tossing each other around a Russian lab.""\r\nAccolades\r\nBlack Widow was one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.\r\nDocumentary special\r\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The specials go behind the scenes of the MCU films and television series with cast members and additional creatives. A special for Black Widow, featuring Johansson, released on Disney+ on October 20, 2021.\r\nFuture\r\nPugh reprised her role in the Disney+ series Hawkeye, with her involvement in the series set up by the film\'s post-credits scene. In June 2021, Shortland expressed interest in directing another film in the MCU, and noted that a potential sequel to Black Widow would likely revolve around a different character since Romanoff is dead in the present-day MCU. Weisz stated that she would be interested in a future storyline featuring Vostokoff assuming her Iron Maiden comic book persona.', 'html': '<p>Black Widow is a 2021 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 24th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Cate Shortland from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, and stars Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, O-T Fagbenle, Olga Kurylenko, William Hurt, Ray Winstone, and Rachel Weisz. Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.</p><p>Lionsgate Films began developing a Black Widow film in April 2004, with David Hayter attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the character\'s film rights had reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with Iron Man 2 (2010), and began discussing a solo film with Marvel. Work began in late 2017, with Shortland hired in 2018. Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson contributed to the script before Pearson was hired. Filming took place from May to October 2019 in Norway, Budapest, Morocco, Pinewood Studios in England, and in Atlanta, Macon, and Rome, Georgia.</p><p>Black Widow premiered at events around the world on June 29, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and through Disney+ with Premier Access. It is the first film in Phase Four of the MCU, and was delayed three times from an original May 2020 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Black Widow broke several pandemic box office records and grossed over $379 million worldwide. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, particularly those of Johansson and Pugh, and the action sequences. In July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against Disney over the simultaneous release, which was settled two months later.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov\'s Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.</p><p>In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room\'s chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.</p><p>Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov\'s location, and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. At the Red Room, an aerial facility, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff\'s disguise and reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage severe enough that Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her, in turn creating the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing a nerve in her nasal passage. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility\'s engines. They then lock Taskmaster in a cell.</p><p>Dreykov escapes as other Black Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov\'s computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane while Belova takes out Dreykov\'s aircraft, killing him. In freefall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.</p><p>In a post-credits scene set after Romanoff\'s death, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine blames her death on Barton and assigns him as Belova\'s next target.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:An Avenger, highly trained former-KGB assassin and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Johansson said she was ""going out on a high note"" and was proud of the film, feeling that her work portraying Romanoff was now complete. She described the film as an opportunity to show the character as ""a woman who has come into her own and is making independent and active choices for herself"", while being in a dark place with no one to call, and felt the character\'s vulnerability set her apart from the other Avengers. Director Cate Shortland watched all of Romanoff\'s MCU appearances consecutively in preparation for the film, and chose to set the story where Romanoff is alone and not ""in relation to anyone else"". Shortland said Romanoff\'s ambiguous psychological journey was the center of the story. Ever Anderson portrays a young Natasha Romanoff. Anderson, who speaks Russian, felt her background in taekwondo and gymnastics training was helpful for the role.</li><li>Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova / Black Widow:A sister to Romanoff who was trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow. Johansson said Belova was an early inclusion in the film who could stand on her own in comparison to Romanoff. Pugh said there was a ""generational difference"" between the two, and described Belova as ""unapologetic, and confident in herself, and curious ... and emotionally brave"". Pugh admired Belova\'s bluntness and determination, and noted that the character is a skilled fighter but does not know how to live a normal life.: 4 Shortland said that Romanoff would be ""handing the baton"" in the film, and Pugh looked to Johansson for guidance during filming on meeting the demands of making Marvel films. Johansson wanted to avoid an antagonistic dynamic between the two characters, instead having a sister-like but contentious relationship that Pugh characterized as ""a sister story that really hones in on grief, on pain, on abuse, on being a victim—and living with being a victim"". Violet McGraw portrays a young Yelena Belova.</li><li>David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian:The Russian super-soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Romanoff and Belova. Harbour said Shostakov was not heroic or noble, and was both comically and tragically flawed. Shostakov claims that he fought Captain America in the 1980s, and screenwriter Eric Pearson felt the character believed that this was true despite it being impossible. For Harbour\'s portrayal, he and Shortland discussed Ricky Gervais\' performance in The Office and Philip Seymour Hoffman\'s in The Savages (2007), ""comedy that comes out of real domestic need"".: 62 Harbour had already grown his facial hair for the fourth season of Stranger Things, and he gained weight for the role to be 280 pounds (127 kg). He then lost 60 pounds (27 kg) over the course of filming to portray a younger version of the character for the film\'s opening flashback sequence.</li><li>O-T Fagbenle as Rick Mason:An ally from Romanoff\'s S.H.I.E.L.D. past who is romantically interested in her. Fagbenle described Mason as a ""finder for people who aren\'t so affiliated with armies"" who assists Romanoff in that manner. On why a romance between Mason and Romanoff is not explored in the film, Fagbenle said the film was ""bigger than that"" and their relationship was part of Romanoff\'s larger family instead. Aside from Pearson\'s script, Fagbenle developed Mason\'s backstory with Shortland and Johansson. As Taskmaster\'s identity was kept secret, many people assumed Mason would secretly take up the mantle, which Fagbenle had to deny even to his personal trainer. The film\'s final scene, in which Mason provides Romanoff with a Quinjet, was added as part of reshoots in early 2020 after test audiences liked seeing Romanoff and Mason together.</li><li>Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster:Dreykov\'s daughter who completes missions for the Red Room. She has photographic reflexes that allow her to mimic opponents\' fighting styles,: 4 and uses techniques from superheroes such as Iron Man, Captain America, the Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, and Black Panther. Several body doubles were required to portray the character\'s various skills. Kurylenko said much of Antonia\'s pain is internal, and described her relationship with Dreykov as abusive since Dreykov uses her ""as a tool has her do whatever he wants"". Taskmaster is revealed to be Antonia in the film instead of the comic book counterpart Tony Masters since Masters is a mercenary that did not fit into the film\'s story and it was more natural to Pearson to tie Taskmaster into a ""loose end from Natasha\'s past"". Ryan Kiera Armstrong portrays a young Antonia Dreykov.</li><li>William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross: The United States Secretary of State and a former U.S. Army general.</li><li>Ray Winstone as Dreykov:A Russian general and the head of the Red Room.: 62: 9 Pearson felt the film needed a villain that could fit within its timeframe undetected so as to avoid contradicting the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). He described Dreykov as a coward who is ""puppeteering things"" from the shadows and does not care about hurting others.</li><li>Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff / Black Widow:A seasoned spy trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow and a mother-figure to Romanoff and Belova who is now one of the Red Room\'s lead scientists.: 4 Compared to Vostokoff\'s comic book counterpart, who becomes the supervillain Iron Maiden, Weisz felt the film\'s version was more ambiguous and layered, with a deadpan personality and no sense of humor which Weisz found amusing. Weisz was given a tailored Black Widow suit for the film which she called an ""iconic"" piece of clothing that was ""a lot to live up to"". Weisz reworked Vostokoff\'s portrayal to be more affectionate towards Shostakov, rather than dismissive.</li></ul><p>Additionally, Liani Samuel, Michelle Lee, and Nanna Blondell appear as Red Room assassins Lerato, Oksana, and Ingrid, respectively, while Jade Xu portrays another Black Widow, later identified as Helen in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). Olivier Richters portrays Ursa Major, a fellow inmate of Shostakov\'s. The film\'s post-credits scene sees Julia Louis-Dreyfus reprising her role as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) in an uncredited cameo appearance. Jeremy Renner reprises his MCU role as Clint Barton in an uncredited voice-only cameo.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><blockquote>""What I tried to do was use the backdrop of the splintered Soviet Empire—a lawless insane asylum with 400-some odd nuclear missile silos. It was all about loose nukes, and I felt it was very timely and very cool. Unfortunately, as I was coming up on the final draft, a number of female vigilante movies came out. We had Tomb Raider and Kill Bill, which were the ones that worked, but then we had BloodRayne and Ultraviolet and Æon Flux. Æon Flux didn\'t open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, \'We don\'t think it\'s time to do this movie.\'""</blockquote><p>—David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward</p><p>In February 2004, Lionsgate acquired the film rights for Black Widow, and in April announced David Hayter as writer and director of the film, with Marvel Studios\' Avi Arad producing. By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter ""never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously"". This left Hayter ""heartbroken"", but he hoped the film would be made ""some day"".</p><p>Marvel entered early talks with Emily Blunt to play Black Widow in Iron Man 2 (2010) in January 2009, but she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver\'s Travels (2010). In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films. In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of Iron Man 2, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel\'s focus was on The Avengers (2012). Johansson reprised her role in that film, as well as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). After the release of Age of Ultron, Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the ""demand of the character"", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience\'s ""great reaction"" to the character and her performance.</p><p>In February 2014, Feige said that after exploring Black Widow\'s past in Age of Ultron, he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it, including a ""pretty in depth"" treatment by Nicole Perlman, who co-wrote Marvel\'s Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience. That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel, and the following month, director Neil Marshall said that he ""would love to do a Black Widow film"", saying he felt the character was ""really interesting she doesn\'t have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-K.G.B. assassin, I find that really fascinating"". In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the character\'s different layers as depicted in her previous appearances. However, she felt that the character was being ""used well in this part of the universe"" at that time. While promoting Civil War the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential Black Widow film would be four or five years away. He added that Marvel was ""creatively and emotionally"" committed to making a Black Widow film eventually.</p><p>Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, said in July 2016 that he was open to directing a Black Widow film, feeling he could make ""a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, \'John le Carré on crack\' sort of thing."" In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, ""you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There\'s all kinds of stuff that you could do with it."" She did caution she may not want to ""wear a skin-tight catsuit"" for much longer. The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film ""amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story."" Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the best time to move forward with the project would be at the beginning of the ""latest phase"" of the MCU in 2020.</p><p>Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a solo film in October 2017, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao. Gao\'s pitch for the film was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then attends a high school reunion 20 years later ""and has to deal with the fallout of this fake identity where she betrayed all these people in high school"". It also heavily featured She-Hulk, with Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum feeling Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow, rather than focusing on Black Widow. Gao would later become the head writer for the TV series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022). Following the #MeToo movement, Johansson wanted the film to comment on the movement which saw women supporting each other and ""coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side"". Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017. Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.</p><p>Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises. By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an ""extremely thorough"" search, including Deniz Gamze Ergüven, Chloé Zhao—who went on to direct Marvel\'s Eternals (2021)—Amma Asante, and Lynn Shelton. Lucrecia Martel was also approached, but was discouraged when told she would not have to ""worry about the action scenes"". She also felt the music and visual effects of Marvel films were ""horrible"". In the following months, a shortlist of 49 directors was made before the top choices of Cate Shortland, Asante, and Maggie Betts met with Feige and Johansson in June. Mélanie Laurent and Kimberly Peirce were also in the ""next-to-final mix"". Johansson was a fan of Shortland\'s previous female-starring film Lore (2012), and was the one who approached her about directing the film;: 1 Shortland was hired in July. Johansson said Black Widow became ""more of a reality"" during the filming of Infinity War and she was also aware of the character\'s death in Endgame. Knowing this helped inform when Black Widow would take place in the MCU timeline. Johansson also believed there was ""no pressing urgency"" to make the film, and that making it when it was, rather than years earlier, allowed the film to be ""about real stuff"".</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the ""low-seven figure salary"" that she earned for starring in The Avengers. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the third films in their MCU franchises—Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok (2017), respectively, and also earned the same amount for co-starring in Infinity War and Endgame. Despite The Hollywood Reporter claiming the salaries were confirmed by ""multiple knowledgeable sources"" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers, saying that they ""never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms."" The Walt Disney Company later stated that Johansson earned $20 million by the end of July 2021 for her work on the film. Johansson also served as an executive producer on the film.</p><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>In February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script, and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is ""morally opposite"" to Romanoff, later revealed to be Yelena Belova. Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses, including Saoirse Ronan, in early 2019. The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019). Devin Grayson and J. G. Jones, who co-created Belova, had expected to receive $25,000 for her appearance in the film due to a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators\' payments. In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, and O-T Fagbenle. Shortland said the film would not be an origin story despite being a prequel to Infinity War and Endgame, as Feige felt that would be expected of a prequel and decided to move in the ""opposite direction"" of that idea. Feige likened the film to the television series Better Call Saul, which is a prequel to the series Breaking Bad, because it was ""a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... it informs you about so many things you didn\'t know about before"". Shortland acknowledged Romanoff\'s death in Endgame and the fact that some fans were upset she did not receive a funeral in that film, but said the character was private and did not know many people so she would not have wanted a funeral. However, Black Widow allowed the ending ""to be the grief the individuals felt, rather than a big public outpouring"".</p><p>Eric Pearson is credited as the screenwriter for Black Widow, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit. The film is mostly set between the main plot of Captain America: Civil War and that film\'s final scene, in which the Avengers escape from prison. Johansson and Feige felt setting the film after Civil War was ""the best place to start"" because it is the first time that Romanoff is on her own and not tied to a larger organization. A version of the script from before Pearson joined had included a scene from Civil War between Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.\'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film, but Shortland and Feige decided against adding Stark or any other heroes to the film in order for Romanoff to stand on her own, and it was determined that the scene did not add anything new. The story sees Romanoff confronting Dreykov, the head of the Red Room, with Johansson explaining that she is running away from that trauma of her past, only for her sister, Belova, to force her to ""come to terms with that"" and face it in the film. Johansson added that these ideas were relevant to real-world events in the time the film was being made, and she was grateful to have the film to comment on these. The film begins with an opening credits sequence designed by Perception, featuring flashbacks to the Red Room and pictures of Dreykov, with Feige explaining that Shortland wanted to tell the story of what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film. A scene at the end of the film in which Thaddeus Ross pursues Romanoff was deliberately left unresolved, as Shortland wanted to leave the audience ""on a high"" questioning how Romanoff escapes rather than exhaust them with another fight.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway. Shortland wanted the film to have ""peril at its heart"" and be ""really emotional but also story-driven"". She took inspiration from films like How to Train Your Dragon (2010),: 63 No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Shortland also looked at combat films and ones with armies and militia, allowing her to image females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow. She referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film\'s fights to resemble ""real fights"" rather than wrestling matches. Early reports suggested that Rob Hardy would be the film\'s cinematographer, but he left the production before filming began. Gabriel Beristain served as cinematographer instead, having previously done so for the Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013) as well as the television series Agent Carter.: 3 Beristain was initially not credited in the film\'s trailers as pointed out by Jeff Sneider of Collider, who wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting the cinematographer at that point. Sneider felt Beristain would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film\'s release, and he was confirmed in the role in the film\'s press advance.: 3 Beristein later confirmed he came as production had already began and moved to London, opting to leave a television directing job so he could be the main cinematographer in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film for the first time, having contributed additional photography for Iron Man and six other films. Shortland preferred to ""be separate to the technical equipment"" and also prioritize natural lighting, which provided a challenge in having to match the light of the location shoots in the additional photography filmed in Los Angeles. The naturalistic approach was also reflected in preferring lighting from outside, or lights with strong diffusion in interior scenes for the same effect. An anamorphic format was chosen to highlight the expansive movements and landscapes, ""characters transitioning from the background to the foreground, crossing the screen in an elegant, majestic way"", and filming those was helped by using an extension system that split the camera\'s image sensor from its body.</p><p>The production moved to Pinewood Studios in London in early June, with Ray Winstone joining the cast later that month. Shooting took place in mid-July at Hankley Common in Surrey, England, under the working title Blue Bayou. The site was made to look like a Russian farmstead, with added helicopter crash sites. The Thursley Parish Council objected to this filming, as it had occurred while Marvel Studios\' application to use the site was still pending. The production planned to revisit the site in late August 2019 for further filming. Black Widow was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con later in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members. In August, bodybuilder Olivier Richters announced that he had been cast in the film, and crew undertook scanning and textured photography at the Well-Safe Guardian oil rig in the North Sea as a reference for visual effects.</p><p>13 BMW X3s were used to create the car chase sequence involving Romanoff and Belova in Budapest, with the crew often switching off the electronic stability control and safety assistance functions to fit with the script, as well as swapping the X3\'s electronic parking brake for a hydraulically actuated one. Second unit director Darrin Prescott explained that the crew would often ""replace the engine or tear the entire body off the car and rebuild it from scratch"". The sequence\'s plot and locations were adjusted to help Prescott create the spontaneous, original stunts that he wanted.</p><p>A wrap party for the film was held at the end of September, before production moved to Macon, Georgia for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including Terminal Station, were dressed to portray Albany, New York. Set photos in October revealed that William Hurt would appear in the film, reprising his MCU role as Thaddeus Ross. Filming also took place in Atlanta, Budapest, Rome, Georgia, and Morocco. The production filmed for 87 days,: 3 and officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>Matthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors.: 3 A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to ""how sexy is she\'s in control"" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene\'s ""male gaze"". In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In early April, Disney announced that Black Widow would be released on November 6, 2020, and the rest of their Phase Four slate of films were shifted to accommodate this. In September 2020, Disney pushed the release back again to May 7, 2021, followed by a third shift in March 2021 to July 9, 2021.</p><p>In April 2021, following Julia Louis-Dreyfus\'s appearance as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the Marvel Studios television series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Louis-Dreyfus had been expected to first appear in Black Widow before its delays pushed the film\'s release to after the series\' premiere on Disney+. Feige later confirmed this, with Black Widow\'s post-credits scene originally intended to be the introduction to the character but now acting as a reference to her appearance in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. He said this was the only change to Marvel\'s Phase Four plans that was forced by the pandemic. The post-credits scene was added after Hawkeye showrunner Jonathan Igla expressed interest in having Yelena Belova in his show, and Eric Pearson was asked to write it without knowing the character revealed as her target. Shortland said in May that the film had been completed a year prior and had not been altered despite the release delays. The release of the film revealed that Olga Kurylenko portrays Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster in the film; Kurylenko\'s involvement was excluded from the film\'s marketing.</p><p>Visual effect vendors included Cinesite, Digital Domain, Industrial Light & Magic, Mammal Studios, SSVFX, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Wētā FX. Digital Domain completed approximately 320 visual effects shots for the film, with work split between its offices in Los Angeles, Montreal and Vancouver, and was primarily responsible for the final battle sequence and creating the Red Room, an airborne fortress hidden in the clouds. The team took inspiration from architecture in the Soviet-era, in addition to incorporating brutalist architecture, and had to plan major aspects of the sequence, such as the lighting, atmosphere, and the altitude. A combination of practical and visual effects were used to create the sequence. Actors and stunt performers were filmed in a wind tunnel against bluescreens while being held aloft using wires and mechanical arms. The surrounding environment was created entirely with computer graphics. Dave Hodgins, the Digital Domain VFX supervisor, said ""Rendering one cloud is easy, but rendering 100 clouds – along with dozens of pieces of big and small debris – is very complex, to say the least."" The visual effects team used GPU rendering to create the bulk of the wreckage and debris, which allowed them to do more in a shorter period of time. The falling debris was created from reference footage of other chunks of debris and additional premade assets, which allowed them to capture a ""diorama of stuff falling in each shot"". Larger pieces were tracked to more recognizable shapes, while a lot of pieces were inserted to make the scene look ""aesthetically pleasing"".</p><p>Industrial Light & Magic completed approximately 800 VFX shots for the film, and worked on the opening airplane escape scene, the Budapest apartment fight along with its subsequent motorcycle and car chase, and the Widows fighting Romanoff in Dreykov\'s room. The opening airplane escape scene was created with half of an airplane rig on a biscuit driving platform with hydraulics. To adjust the lighting of the scene, the footage filmed in Atlanta and the dirt path along the cornfield was taken to LED screens, while close-up shots of David Harbour\'s Shostakov hanging off the plane were captured onstage. Footage of practical cars were also filmed using a rig which launched them, while additional CGI cars were also inserted into the sequence. To create the Budapest scenes, ILM collaborated closely with the second unit director Darren Prescott. The combat scene in the kitchen was filmed using a wire rig, while both Johansson and Pugh performed their movements against the stunt doubles for the other sister to aid in the face replacements for stunt doubles in post. Their chase across the rooftops was also a combination of practical and visual effects. Scenes involving smokestacks were created using virtual actors, while the courtyard was a digitally recreated environment. The car chase scene in Budapest features a practical tank driven by Taskmaster created by Paul Corbould, the special effects supervisor. Digital cars were also added to the scene to make it appear more dangerous and for better interaction with the tank. While most components of the scene was filmed practically using stunt doubles, some parts, such as the scene where the door is ripped, was created digitally. For the fight scene in Dreykov\'s office, the team used a projector onset to adjust the lighting on the Widow\'s bodies. They had to change the position to fix the lighting, as the screens displayed graphics and to adjust to the choreography of the sequence.</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>Alexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020. Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020. A cover of Nirvana\'s ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Think Up Anger, featuring Malia J, is used in the opening credits sequence, and was suggested by Perception. ""American Pie"" by Don McLean and ""Cheap Thrills"" by Sia are also featured in the film. Balfe\'s score was released digitally by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records on July 9, 2021.</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><p>The film was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, with Feige, Shortland, and cast members promoting it and introducing footage from the first 30 days of production. Some of that footage was included in a teaser trailer for the film released in December, with several commentators highlighting its spy thriller tone, and calling the film ""long awaited"" or ""highly anticipated"" by fans. Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue said finally seeing a trailer for the film was ""surprisingly emotional"", and felt that setting it between Civil War and Infinity War would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film after earlier MCU films had depicted her in a supporting role to the male Avengers. Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the trailer\'s story and tone to the films Atomic Blonde (2017), Red Sparrow (2018), and Anna (2019), but felt Black Widow had a commercial advantage over those films since it stars a familiar character. Mendelson thought this familiarity could outweigh the teaser\'s focus on ""family melodrama"" over superheroics, which he compared to Marvel\'s Thor (2011). The Hollywood Reporter\'s Richard Newby found noticeable differences between Shortland\'s shot composition and cinematography in the trailer compared to the styles of Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers, all directors who helped define Black Widow in previous MCU films. What was intended to be the final trailer for the film debuted in March 2020. Nicole Carpenter of Polygon said it was the most in-depth look at the film yet, with Josh Weiss of Syfy Wire enjoying its quieter moments in addition to the expected action sequences. Mendelson found the trailer to be an improvement over the teaser, attributing this to its theme of ""found families (the Avengers), forced families () and actual family"" portrayed by Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz.</p><p>Disney\'s president of marketing Asad Ayaz said that after Black Widow was delayed from its original May 2020 release date, the marketing team paused their campaign for the film. Once they began working towards a new release date in 2021, they were able to use character looks and story points that they had not revealed in the initial campaign to build a new approach to the film. Ayaz explained that they did not want it to feel like they had returned to the same marketing campaign, which focused on the Black Widow symbol and her black costume. The marketing team differentiated the new campaign by featuring the character\'s white costume from the film instead, and by focusing on her legacy as an Avenger. The campaign featured 30 brands, including co-branded opportunities with GEICO, Ziploc, BMW, and Synchrony Bank. Additional custom partnerships occurred with Fandango, YouTube, Roku, TikTok, Amazon, a Twitter E3 gaming sponsorship, and announcements, posters, and collectibles for the various premium theater experiences such as IMAX.</p><p>In September 2020, Barbie released two Black Widow dolls featuring the black and white outfits worn by Romanoff in the film. Marvel released another trailer for the film in April 2021, which Austen Goslin at Polygon felt was a new ""final"" trailer for the film\'s new release date. He said it only had a few new scenes in it but provided the best look yet at Taskmaster. Goslin highlighted the Russian-inspired version of The Avengers theme music used at the end of the trailer. Germain Lussier of io9 also highlighted the use of The Avengers theme, feeling that the music combined with footage from previous MCU films as well as flashback moments of Natasha and her family made the trailer feel more epic than the previous final trailer. Lussier said it was a trailer that ""gets you excited for the return"" of MCU films. Ethan Anderton of /Film said the ""epic"" free-falling fight with Taskmaster showcased in the trailer ""looks like a sequence unlike any other"" in the MCU. The trailer received over 70 million views in its first 24 hours. On July 5, Moneymaker: Behind the Black Widow, a half-hour documentary special centered on Johansson\'s stunt double Heidi Moneymaker, premiered on ESPN+ as part of ESPN\'s E60 series. The special was directed by Martin Khodabakhshian and narrated by Johansson. A subsequent, eight-minute version of the special aired on ESPN\'s Outside the Lines on July 10. An episode of the series Marvel Studios: Legends was released on July 7, exploring Black Widow using footage from her previous MCU appearances.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical and Premier Access</h4><p>Black Widow premiered on June 29, 2021, at various red carpet fan events in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and New York City. It screened at the Taormina Film Fest on July 3, and was released in the United States on July 9, simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access for US$30. It premiered in 46 territories over the course of its first weekend. In the U.S. it opened in 4,100 theaters, with 375 in IMAX, over 800 in premium large format, 1,500 in 3D, and 275 in specialty D-Box, 4DX, and ScreenX theaters. In IMAX screenings, approximately 22 minutes of the film appeared in IMAX\'s expanded aspect ratio. Black Widow is the first film released in Phase Four of the MCU. Release dates for China, Taiwan, India, parts of Australia, and other Southeast Asia and Latin America markets were not set by the film\'s opening weekend, and by mid-September 2021, the film was not expected to be released theatrically in China.</p><p>The film was originally scheduled for release on May 1, 2020. In early March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic had caused the closure of theaters in many countries, the release date for the film No Time to Die was shifted from April 2020 to November 2020. Commentators began speculating about the potential for other major films like Black Widow to be postponed as well. Deadline Hollywood reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that Black Widow would take the November release date of Marvel\'s Eternals, with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney said that it still intended to release Black Widow in May 2020. After a trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at Forbes highlighted how the trailer\'s existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed. He said this was ""the logical choice at this juncture"", feeling it was the ideal release date for the film and there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect its performance in the U.S. A week later, theaters across the U.S. were closed due to the pandemic and gatherings larger than 50 people were discouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Disney removed the film from its May release date. Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly at Variety questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by the delay than other franchises due to its interconnected nature, though a Marvel Studios source told them that changing the film\'s release date would not affect the MCU timeline. The pair speculated that this was due to the film being a prequel set earlier in the timeline than other Phase Four films. In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate due to the pandemic, giving Eternals\' November 6, 2020, release date to Black Widow and shifting all of its other Phase Four films back in the release schedule to accommodate this.</p><p>Anthony D\'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood reported in September 2020 that Disney was considering rescheduling Black Widow again, with Variety also reporting this and attributing it to the low box office returns for Disney\'s Mulan in China and Warner Bros.\' Tenet in North America. Later that month, Disney pushed back the release to May 7, 2021, rescheduling Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) as a result. In January 2021, Feige said he still expected Black Widow to debut in theaters, but Variety reported that Disney was considering releasing the film on its streaming service Disney+. There was also potential to delay the film\'s release again if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic did not improve leading up to the planned May 2021 release, or to release the film concurrently in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access as was done with Disney\'s Raya and the Last Dragon (2021). Variety felt it would be ""insurmountably more challenging"" for Black Widow to become profitable if it did not have a traditional theatrical release. In early February, Disney CEO Bob Chapek reaffirmed that Black Widow was intended to be solely released in theaters, but Disney was cognizant of theaters reopening, particularly in large cities such as New York and Los Angeles, as well as consumer desire to return to theaters. According to Variety, Feige was opposed to a hybrid release for the film. If the film was delayed again, the film distribution industry believed Disney would move it to July 9, 2021, which at that point was the release date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The next month, Chapek reiterated that Disney planned to release Black Widow in theaters on May 7, while Deadline Hollywood again noted that delaying the film, releasing it simultaneously on Disney+, or releasing it in theaters for a short time before making it available on Disney+ were all still possibilities. Chapek soon stated that Disney was remaining flexible as they gauged consumer behavior, and they would make a final decision on releasing the film at the ""last minute"".</p><p>In late March, Disney moved the film\'s release date to July 9, 2021, and announced that it would release simultaneously on Disney+ with Premier Access. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was delayed again as a result. Kareem Daniel, the chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, said the simultaneous release gave fans options to see the film while serving the ""evolving preferences of audiences"". Chaim Gartenberg at The Verge opined that Disney had to move forward with a simultaneous release for the film because they could not afford to delay Marvel\'s Phase Four television series. He explained that those series were some of the few ""high-profile, must-watch shows"" on Disney+, and once they began releasing with WandaVision in January 2021 there was only so much time that the films could be delayed before the interconnected nature of Marvel\'s storytelling began causing issues. For instance, the series Hawkeye was expected to release later in 2021 and contain spoilers for Black Widow, so the film needed to be released before then. Gartenberg described Disney and Marvel as being victims of their own success, but felt the potential revenue loss from the simultaneous release could lead to long-term positives such as fans who otherwise would not have watched Marvel\'s series potentially discovering them when signing up to Disney+ to watch Black Widow.</p><h4>Lawsuit</h4><p>In July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging that the simultaneous release of Black Widow on Disney+ breached a stipulation in her contract that the film receive an exclusive theatrical release. The suit stated that the simultaneous release exempted Disney from paying ""very large box office bonuses"" that Johansson would have reportedly been entitled to. According to The Wall Street Journal, Johansson had been concerned about the possibility of the film being released on Disney+ since prior to the release of Avengers: Endgame. Vulture contributor Chris Lee opined that not having any planned appearances in future MCU projects would have emboldened Johansson to file the lawsuit. Disney issued a statement in response, saying the suit was meritless and calling it a ""callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."" Additionally, the company claimed that they had fully complied with Johansson\'s contract and that the Disney+ Premier Access release of the film had ""significantly enhanced ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.""</p><p>Bryan Lourd, Johansson\'s agent and co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), criticized Disney\'s response by arguing that the company had ""shamelessly and falsely accused Ms. Johansson of being insensitive to the global COVID pandemic"" and accusing them of ""leaving artistic and financial partners"" out of their streaming profits, with CAA criticizing Disney\'s disclosure of Johansson\'s $20 million earnings as ""an attempt to weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of."" The advocacy organizations Women in Film, ReFrame, and Time\'s Up also released a joint statement criticizing Disney\'s response, calling it a ""gendered character attack"" and saying they ""stand firmly against Disney\'s recent statement which attempts to characterize Johansson as insensitive or selfish for defending her contractual business rights"". TheWrap reported that Johansson was shocked by the tone of Disney\'s response, while Disney chairman and former CEO Bob Iger was allegedly mortified by the lawsuit. Feige was reportedly angered and embarrassed by Disney\'s handling of the situation, and wanted the company to make it right with Johansson. SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris also criticized Disney\'s response, saying they ""should be ashamed of themselves for resorting to tired tactics such as gender-shaming and bullying"". In response to these criticisms, Disney attorney Daniel Petrocelli called the suit a ""highly orchestrated campaign to achieve an outcome that is not obtainable in a lawsuit"".</p><p>Eriq Gardner at The Hollywood Reporter believed Johansson\'s case was potentially weak since disputes of this kind usually take place in arbitration, and that she had been forced into presenting a claim of tortious interference rather than a standard contract breach due to a clause in her contract. Gardner added that Johansson\'s complaint of Disney not waiting a few months for the market to recover from the impact of the pandemic was countered by the fact that Disney had already delayed the film\'s release by a year, since Disney would not want to wait too long after Avengers: Endgame to release Black Widow when the MCU was already moving on. This was especially true since the film introduces important new characters to the franchise such as Yelena Belova. Screen Daily editor Matt Mueller told BBC News that he believed the case would be resolved between Disney and Johansson before reaching court, and expressed surprise that Disney had let it get to this stage, given Warner Bros. had made agreements with stars for simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max of titles like Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). Mueller also believed the case would prompt other major Hollywood studios with streaming services to look at what ""contractual steps"" they would need to prevent further legal action like this. Variety reported in July 2021 that the case had prompted other Disney actors to consider similar litigations.</p><p>In August, Disney filed a motion to move the lawsuit to arbitration, citing that Black Widow outgrossed other MCU films on its opening weekend with an ""impressive pandemic-era showing"". Johansson\'s attorney John Berlinski criticized this move as an attempt by Disney to ""hide its misconduct in a confidential arbitration"", while describing their previous responses as misogynistic. A month later, the suit was settled under undisclosed terms, though Deadline Hollywood reported that Johansson would receive over $40 million from Disney. The settlement came after Disney chose to give theatrical-only releases to subsequent 2021 films following the box office success of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Free Guy (2021), which both also received exclusive theatrical windows when initially released. In November 2021, Johansson said in regards to the lawsuit that she felt ""very fortunate that nobody will have to go through what I went through"" and thought the case had made ""a positive impact in the industry and hopefully for artists and creatives\' lives and livelihood.""</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Black Widow was released in the U.S. on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 10, 2021, and was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 14. Deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes were included. The film was made available to all Disney+ subscribers for streaming starting October 6. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>Black Widow grossed $183.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $196.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $379.8 million. The film\'s opening weekend earned $226.2 million globally, which included $80.4 million domestic box office, $78.8 million international box office, and $67 million in Disney+ Premier Access global revenue. The opening weekend gross was within or exceeded various pre-release projections. In June 2021, Fandango reported that the film had the most ticket presales in 2021, and surpassed other MCU films like Doctor Strange (2016) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).</p><p>Black Widow earned $39.5 million on its opening day, including $13.2 million from Thursday night previews, which was the best preview night and opening day since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Its total weekend gross was $80.4 million, making it the top film of the weekend. This was the largest box office opening since the COVID-19 pandemic began, surpassing F9\'s opening ($70 million), and the largest opening weekend since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The domestic gross was within some of the pre-release projections for the film, though was considered under some industry projections made during the weekend after examining its opening night and preview grosses; Deadline Hollywood attributed some of this to the film\'s availability on Disney+ with Premier Access. When the $80.4 million theatrical gross was combined with the domestic Premier Access revenue of $55 million, totaling over $135.4 million for its opening weekend, Disney noted Black Widow was the only film to surpass $100 million in domestic consumer spend on opening weekend since the start of the pandemic, and marked the third largest opening ever for an MCU origin film, behind Black Panther ($202 million) and Captain Marvel ($153.4 million). Following its opening weekend, Black Widow posted the largest non-holiday Monday ($7.16 million) and Tuesday ($7.6 million) gross in the pandemic. The film passed $100 million in domestic box office six days after release, making it the fastest to do so in the pandemic.</p><p>In its second weekend, the film grossed $25.8 million, finishing second behind Space Jam: A New Legacy. Its 67% drop marked the largest sophomore week decline for an MCU film, passing Ant-Man and the Wasp (62%). Box office analysts attributed Black Widow\'s second-week decline to its Disney+ Premier Access release, as well as widely reported piracies of the film online. In its third weekend, the film earned a further $11.6 million and became the fastest film to reach $150 million in total domestic box office gross in the pandemic. Black Widow was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 in the United States.</p><p>Outside of North America, Black Widow earned $78.8 million in its opening weekend, from 46 markets. It was the number one film in nearly all of these markets, including the markets in the Asia Pacific region where it opened, excluding Japan, where it was third, and all markets in the Latin America region. Black Widow was the top pandemic opening weekend in 15 European markets. IMAX accounted for $4.8 million of the weekend gross, from 59 countries, 11 of which set opening weekend records for the pandemic. In Korea, the film\'s opening day was the second-best of 2021, with $3.3 million, and Hong Kong had the best opening of the pandemic, with $3.2 million. The film had the largest opening day of the pandemic in Austria, the Czech Republic, Qatar, and Slovakia, while in Saudi Arabia, the film earned the highest opening day for a Disney release ever. It was the number one film on opening day in many other markets. As of October 20, 2021, the top markets are Korea ($26.3 million), the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), and France ($15.1 million).</p><h4>Streaming viewership</h4><p>With Disney+ Premier Access, Black Widow earned $67 million worldwide in its opening weekend; it marked the first film Disney revealed Premier Access revenue for, with the revenue skewing heavily towards the United States with $55 million. Viewer tracking application Samba TV, which measures at least five minutes of viewership on smart televisions in over 3 million U.S. households, reported that 1.1 million households watched the film in its opening weekend. Deadline Hollywood noted that this viewership translated to about $33 million in revenue for Disney, considering the U.S.$29.99 price of Premier Access, which lined up with the announced worldwide revenue. The site also stated that Disney was receiving about 85% of the Disney+ Premier revenue, sharing the rest with platform providers such as Amazon Firestick and Apple TV+.</p><p>The following weekend, Deadline reported that Black Widow had become the most-pirated film of the past week, while some industry sources believed it had become the most-pirated film of the pandemic. Samba TV later updated the film\'s Disney+ Premier Access viewership, reporting that the film had been streamed over 2 million times in the U.S. over its first 10 days of release, which resulted in around $60 million in overall domestic revenue from Disney+. Samba TV also reported updates to 10-day viewership in the United Kingdom (258,000), Germany (116,000), and Australia (47,000). In October, Samba TV reported that over 1.1 million U.S. households had watched Black Widow in the first five days of its availability to all subscribers on Disney+. They also reported viewership in the United Kingdom (190,000) and Germany (96,000) during that same time frame. As of August 15, 2021, Black Widow has earned $125 million through streaming and digital downloads. In its first 30 days, the film was watched in over 2.8 million U.S. households. Deadline Hollywood also reported the film had been pirated over 20 million times, resulting in at least $600 million in lost revenue for Disney. In January 2022, tech firm Akami reported that Black Widow was the third-most pirated film of 2021.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 79%, with an average score of 6.9/10, based on 449 reviews. The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""Black Widow\'s deeper themes are drowned out in all the action, but it remains a solidly entertaining standalone adventure that\'s rounded out by a stellar supporting cast."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 88% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.</p><p>Owen Gleiberman of Variety initially feared Black Widow would be two hours of Johansson being ""a kick-ass fighter in sleek leather with a few signature jackknife moves"" but instead found the film to be ""much more interesting and absorbing"" and ""features just enough kinetic combat to give a mainstream audience that getting-your-money\'s-worth feeling, but from the opening credits, most of it has a gritty, deliberate, zap-free tone that is strikingly — and intentionally — earthbound for a superhero fantasy."" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com praised Pugh\'s performance as ""finding just the right shades of strength and vulnerability"" and as ""the film\'s MVP"".</p><p>Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Black Widow a ""high-octane espionage thriller"" that "" away from the superhero template."" Rooney added the film was ""a stellar vehicle"" for Johansson and praised the supporting cast. Joshua Rivera of Polygon wrote ""Black Widow has a focus that\'s refreshing to the MCU, allowing it a sense of style and fun that\'s genuinely enjoyable once you get over the strangeness of the film\'s continuity in the MCU"", although he said the film feels ""hollow"" and like an ""apology"" after the death of Romanoff in Avengers: Endgame. IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn gave the film a B grade, writing, ""Like the welcoming breeziness of Spider-Man: Homecoming, the saga of Natasha and Yelena doesn\'t try to rope in the fate of the known universe to make its operation worthwhile. The relatively low stakes help to foreground their moody dynamic, at least whenever the hand-to-hand combat doesn\'t get there first. Fortunately, the movie delivers on that front, most notably during a brawl between Black Widow and the robotic killer known as Taskmaster who mirrors her every move. If this is the last time we get to see Johansson mete out justice to her assailants with gymnastic velocity, it\'s an apt send-off.""</p><p>Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood wrote that Johansson ""goes out with all guns blazing as this first film in Phase 4 of the MCU does not stint one bit on the action,"" with a film that ""more importantly focuses on the human being behind the shield of a superhero."" Hammond felt that the opening sequence revealing Romanoff\'s family construct are actually Russian spies was reminiscent of The Americans, while he praised the chemistry between Johansson and Pugh, ""with Natasha\'s awkward shyness counterpunched by the lively and cynical Yelena."" Of the performances, Hammond said: ""Johansson is again a great presence in the role, showing expert action and acting chops throughout, while Pugh is clearly ready to lead her own franchise after this MCU debut. Weisz is simply such a good actor she can even make some of the more ridiculous dialogue land, and Harbour, tatted to the hilt, is clearly having a blast overplaying every moment of a character designed to think only about himself."" Hammond also said ""having Winstone in this picture lifts it several notches, and he is deliciously fun and scarily authentic as the villain of the piece.""</p><p>Writing for BBC Culture, Caryn James gave the film four out of five stars, opining that the film was ""the least Avenger-like movie in the so far"", and that ""after all this time a tweak in the formula is a good thing."" James, like Hammond, noted the film\'s opening sequence as reminiscent of The Americans, while she praised Pugh\'s performance, calling Belova ""the most vibrant person in the film, more lived-in than most action-movie characters."" James, however, also noted the film\'s presentation of ""the perfect metaphor for Russia v the West"" with ""the Russians hav developed a synthetic formula that can suppress free will"" with ""nothing deep or heavy about the film\'s treatment of that idea"". James also felt that Romanoff was ""the least interesting character"" amongst her family, being ""an odd fit for the sly family movie unfolding around her"", and felt the film had a ""typically Avengers"" ending with ""an overwrought, too-long action scene that plays like a festival of stunt doubles tossing each other around a Russian lab.""</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>Black Widow was one of 28 films that received the ReFrame Stamp for 2021, awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame for films that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring.</p><table class=""table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100""><caption><style data-mw-deduplicate=""TemplateStyles:r1015390333"">.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px;white-space:nowrap}</style><span class=""sr-only"">Accolades received by Black Widow</span></caption><tbody><tr><th scope=""col"" style=""width:22%;"">Award</th><th scope=""col"">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=""col"">Category</th><th scope=""col"">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=""col"">Result</th><th scope=""col"" class=""unsortable""><abbr title=""Reference(s)"">Ref(s)</abbr></th></tr><tr><th rowspan=""4"" scope=""row"" style=""text-align:center;""><span>Golden Trailer Awards</span></th><td rowspan=""4""><span data-sort-value=""000000002021-07-22-0000"" style=""white-space:nowrap"">July 22, 2021</span></td><td>Best Fantasy Adventure</td><td>""Control"" (MOCEAN)</td><td style=""background: #9EFF9E;

A teenage orphan finds clues to a contest that promises the ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an evil corporation can do so.\r\nDevelopment of the film first began in 2010 when Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the book. In July 2015, Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, with casting commencing in September 2015. Filming began in England in June 2016 and was completed in September that year. The visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, and Territory Studio, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor. As with the novel, many popular culture references appear throughout the film, including references to The Shining, the Back to the Future franchise, and The Iron Giant.\r\nReady Player One premiered at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Spielberg\'s direction, the visual effects, brisk pacing, and the performances of both Sheridan and Rylance. It grossed around $583 million worldwide, and earned a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics\' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards. Ready Player One was awarded the title of Best Science Fiction Film at the 45th Saturn Awards, and a further two Outstanding Achievement Awards from the Visual Effects Society. A sequel is in development.\r\nPlot\r\nIn a dystopian 2045, people seek to escape from reality through the virtual reality entertainment universe called the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday\'s death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden Easter egg within it, which gets locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several ""Gunters"", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of indentured servants, and employees called ""Sixers"" to find the egg.\r\nTeenage orphan Wade Watts\' avatar Parzival, an avid Gunter, participates in the first challenge, an unbeatable race, along with his best friend Aech, and Art3mis, a female avatar on whom Parzival has a crush. Parzival regularly visits Halliday\'s Journals, a simulated archive of Halliday\'s life and hobbies, run by the Curator. Wade receives the Copper Key from Anorak after he wins by driving backward, while Art3mis, Aech, and his friends Daito and Sho, all win the race afterward, later being collectively named the High-5 on the OASIS\' scoreboard.\r\nSorrento asks mercenary i-R0k to learn Wade\'s true identity, intending to bribe him to win the contest on IOI\'s behalf. Wade and Art3mis discover from the Journals that Halliday once dated Morrow\'s wife Karen ""Kira"" Underwood. Wade and Art3mis visit the Distracted Globe night club to look for clues, where Wade confesses his love and true name to Art3mis. They survive an IOI raid in which Art3mis abandons Wade, explaining that her father died in debt to IOI. i-R0k, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, informs Sorrento of his findings. Sorrento contacts Wade with his offer. When rejected, Sorrento attempts to dispose of Wade by bombing his home, killing his aunt Alice and her boyfriend Rick among others. Art3mis\' player Samantha Cook takes Wade in. Together, they realize the second challenge relates to Halliday\'s regret of not pursuing a relationship with Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, Parzival and Art3mis search for the recreation of the Overlook Hotel. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and wins the Jade Key. Sorrento\'s subordinate F\'Nale Zandor storms the Gunters\' hideout, taking Samantha to an IOI Loyalty Center to pay off her father\'s debt. Wade escapes with the help of the other High-5 users, Helen Harris (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho) in Helen\'s truck. Samantha escapes confinement after Aech and Parzival hack Sorrento\'s OASIS rig.\r\nThe third challenge is found in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom, where players must guess Halliday\'s favorite Atari 2600 game to earn the Crystal Key. i-R0k places a forcefield around the castle using the Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis soon disables it. The High-5 lead an army of OASIS players against IOI\'s forces. Parzival kills Samantha\'s avatar, allowing her to flee IOI with the High-5 picking her up nearby. Parzival and Sorrento fight in the OASIS with Sorrento detonating the Cataclyst bomb, wiping out every avatar on Planet Doom including himself. Parzival survives using an extra life coin given to him earlier by the Curator in a bet. He plays Adventure, winning the Crystal Key by locating Warren Robinett\'s Easter egg. He uses the three keys to enter a treasure room, where Anorak offers him a contract to sign. Parzival recognizes it as the one Morrow signed when Halliday forced him out of Gregarious Games and refuses to sign it. Anorak transforms into Halliday, who expresses his regrets in life and awards Parzival the Easter egg.\r\nOgden Morrow appears, revealing that he is the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High-5, inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. After Aech sends the police a copy of Sorento confessing to the bombing, he and F\'Nale are arrested. As the IOI Loyalty Centers are shut down, the High-5 make the controversial choice to close the OASIS every Tuesday and Thursday for people to spend more time in the real world, including Wade and Samantha, who start a relationship.\r\nCast\r\nTye Sheridan as Wade Watts / Parzival\r\nOlivia Cooke as Samantha Cooke / Art3mis\r\nBen Mendelsohn as Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321\r\nLena Waithe as Helen Harris / Aech\r\nT.J.

Ernest Cline was set to write the script for the film, which De Line and Farah would produce. Eric Eason rewrote Cline\'s script, and Zak Penn was hired to rewrite the previous drafts by Cline and Eason (who became uncredited for the final draft), along with Village Roadshow Pictures coming aboard. Steven Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, which Kristie Macosko Krieger also produced, along with De Line and Farah. Cline and Penn made several revisions while adapting the novel to film. Most of these changes were to eliminate scenes that would be uninteresting in a visual format, such as when Wade beats a high score in Pac-Man, or recites all the lines from the film WarGames. In 2016, American musician Moby said he had tried to make the book into a movie, but discovered that Spielberg had taken the role before him.\r\nElle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirke were the frontrunners for the role of Art3mis; with Cooke announced as having been cast in the role by September 2015. In January 2016, Ben Mendelsohn joined the cast. In February 2016, Tye Sheridan was confirmed to play Wade, after a lengthy casting search for the role. Simon Pegg was added to the cast in March, with Mark Rylance joining in April. By June, T.J. Miller, Hannah John-Kamen, and Win Morisaki had also been cast in the film. In July, Philip Zhao joined the cast, with Lena Waithe, Ralph Ineson, Mckenna Grace, and Letitia Wright being revealed as appearing in the film over time prior to the film\'s release.\r\nIn October 2019, Doctor Sleep director Mike Flanagan revealed that Jack Nicholson, who portrayed Jack Torrance in The Shining, was approached to appear in the film, but declined the offer due to his retirement.\r\nFilming\r\nProduction was slated to begin in July 2016, but on July 1, 2016, screenwriter Zak Penn confirmed that the first week of filming had already been completed (means that filming began on June 25, 2016). In August and September 2016, filming took place in Birmingham, England, standing in for Columbus, Ohio. Birmingham filming included on Livery Street in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city, which was used for multiple scenes in the film. Ludgate Hill Car Park lot on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built, was also used, and a planned explosion there caused some local businesses and residents to call emergency services as no prior notice was given by the production team. Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of Digbeth, and some of the city\'s landmarks were erased and replaced with CGI buildings to create a dystopian future Ohio. Outside of Birmingham, filming also took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and at Solaris House, the former Sun Microsystems headquarters in Surrey. Principal photography wrapped on September 27, 2016.\r\nVisual effects\r\nIndustrial Light & Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, and Territory Studio developed the visual effects, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor. For three hours three days a week, Spielberg met with ILM, which was in charge of the OASIS segments and produced the bulk of the visual effects shots, with 900 in total; Spielberg remarked that ""this is the most difficult movie I\'ve done since Saving Private Ryan"", as three 3-hour long meetings a week were necessitated to discuss the visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett stated that the VFX team would collaborate with Spielberg and writers Cline and Penn:\r\nWhat we did at one point was to have a card for every single character that we considered to be a ""hero"" character within the movie, and we put them up on a board and Steven and everyone else spent hours assigning them to scenes. We\'d say, ""This is where we want whoever it would be … Batman, Chun-Li, or whoever."" And then we went through the whole movie doing that. As the scenes developed, we got an understanding of how many characters we needed.\r\nPart of the film takes place in a virtual space based on the Overlook Hotel in the film The Shining. This was mostly a digital recreation using high-quality telecine of the original film, allowing new camera angles and shots that did not appear in the original. Some original footage from The Shining was also used, with ILM\'s modifications. Only a few scenes in this sequence involved real actors (such as the appearance of the Grady twins) and required reproduction of The Shining\'s physical sets. The Shining sequence was post-processed with film grain and other aging effects to make the new footage closely resemble the original. During the production of Ready Player One, The VFX team built the sequence the Overlook Hotel in the digital realm. Stanley Kubrick\'s blueprints were used to recreate the hotel in the film. ILM also had to produce digital versions of the film\'s many cultural references, including the DeLorean time machine (from the Back to the Future films); the Iron Giant; Chucky; and King Kong, modeled after the 1933 film version. The Tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park was created from the base model ILM had created. Digital Domain facilitated pre-visualization (with The Third Floor), motion capture, and virtual sets, and also created 300 visual effects shots for the primarily live-action portions of the film. The virtual sets were powered by game engines and were used congruently with the motion-capture process, with previsualization supervisor Scott Meadows explaining that in real time Spielberg would ""put on a headset and scout the sets and make adjustments.""\r\nMusic\r\nOn June 9, 2016, John Williams was initially going to compose the film\'s score. However, in July 2017, Williams left the project in favor of scoring Spielberg\'s The Post, and Alan Silvestri took over scoring duties for the film. The official score was released by WaterTower Music as a two-CD set on March 30, 2018, with vinyl and cassette releases projected. At Spielberg\'s request, Silvestri references his own music from Back to the Future within the film\'s score, as well as quoting music written by other composers including Max Steiner\'s theme from King Kong, Akira Ifukube’s main theme from Godzilla, and the score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind from The Shining.\r\nCultural references\r\nReady Player One pays homage to popular culture from various time periods, mainly the 1970s and 1980s but also extending to the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s; reviewers have identified over a hundred references to films, television shows, music, toys, video games, anime, and comics from these eras. Cline did not have any issues with these copyrighted elements when he published the book, but was aware that securing all necessary rights would be a major obstacle for a film adaptation. This task was eventually made easier thanks to Spielberg\'s reputation in the film industry. In the end, Spielberg estimated that they managed to get about 80% of the copyrighted elements they desired. The production was not able to secure Close Encounters of the Third Kind from Columbia Pictures.\r\nThe Dungeons & Dragons module Tomb of Horrors features in an important episode of the book, the ""Copper Key challenge"", but that reference was excluded from the film, where the challenge features a huge car race in New York instead. However, the movie does reference the module: artwork of the Tomb of Horrors demon appears on the back of Aech\'s van.\r\nSimilarly Blade Runner, which was integral to the plot of the book, was shelved as Blade Runner 2049 was in production at the same time as Ready Player One and the producers at Alcon Entertainment feared that Spielberg\'s film could damage the commercial prospects of their film; as a replacement, the creative team had the players play through the events of The Shining, which Spielberg was able to secure the rights to as an homage to his friend Stanley Kubrick. Penn and Cline also thought that the film could be the opportunity to replace such a lengthy sequence with a more action-heavy one. Once they decided to use The Shining, they were doubtful at first that Spielberg would accept the change, but Spielberg did go for it. While Cline\'s original work heavily used the character of Ultraman, the rights over the character were still under legal dispute, requiring them to replace Ultraman with the titular robot from The Iron Giant and RX-78-2 Gundam. Spielberg recognized that his past films were a significant part of the 1980s popular culture cited in the book, and to avoid being accused of ""vanity"", he opted to remove many of the references to his own work. Cline stated that he believed Spielberg wanted to avoid self-references to films he directed, due to the criticism he received for his film 1941, which lampooned his own previous works Jaws and Duel. Cline said he had to convince Spielberg to include some iconic elements, such as the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, which Spielberg conceded as the film was one he produced rather than directed. Spielberg also allowed the Tyrannosaurus rex from his own Jurassic Park to be included. Cline also asked ILM to include a reference to Last Action Hero, one of Penn\'s first screenplays, without Penn\'s knowledge; a movie marquee in the Manhattan race segment bears the name ""Jack Slater"", the character Arnold Schwarzenegger played in that film.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nReady Player One was originally scheduled to be released on December 15, 2017. However, on February 9, 2016, the film was delayed to March 30, 2018, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. In January 2018, it was announced the film\'s release date had been moved up one day to March 29, 2018. The film had its world premiere at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018 (as part of the South by Southwest Film Festival). Warner Bros. distributed the film worldwide, with Village Roadshow Pictures distributing in several overseas territories. Around the same time the film was released, massively multi-player online game platform Roblox held an event based on it. The winner of the event was the user r0cu.\r\nHome media\r\nReady Player One was released on digital copy on July 3, 2018, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 24, 2018. The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart, a tracker of combined domestic Blu-Ray and DVD unit sales, for the week ending on July 27, 2018. It retained the No. 1 spot on the chart for the week ending on August 4, 2018.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nReady Player One grossed $137.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $445.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $583 million. Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film needed to gross at least $440 million in order to break even.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, Ready Player One was projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,100 theaters over its first four days. It made $12.1 million on its first day, including $3.75 million from Wednesday night previews. It ended up grossing $41.8 million in its opening weekend (for a four-day total of $53.7 million). The film made $24.6 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomer A Quiet Place, and $11.5 million in its third weekend, finishing in fourth.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 444 reviews. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""Ready Player One is a sweetly nostalgic thrill ride that neatly encapsulates Spielberg\'s strengths while adding another solidly engrossing adventure to his filmography."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 82% overall positive score and a 65% ""definite recommend"".\r\nIn a review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote that the film\'s ""overwhelming"" nature and non-stop action will likely thrill fans of pop culture; while he observed narrative weaknesses, such as a lack of depth among the supporting characters, he felt that they ultimately do not hinder the film from working ""on the level of technical, blockbuster mastery that Spielberg helped define"". Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called the film a ""coruscating explosion of pop-culture eye candy"" and found the sequence based on The Shining to be ""irresistible"". However, he criticized Spielberg\'s separation of fantasy and reality, and he said the film has ""more activity than it does layers"". IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn characterized the film as ""an astonishing sci-fi spectacle and a relentless nostalgia trip at once"" and praised both the sequence based on The Shining and Penn\'s screenplay, particularly with respect to Mendelsohn\'s character. Nevertheless, he remarked that the film ""drags a bunch in its final third"". Alissa Wilkinson, writing for Vox, praised both the quality and quantity of the worldbuilding. She also commented on just how dystopian the future portrayed is, where the main characters fight to save the OASIS and the escape from reality it represents, with arguably less concern for the problems of the real world. Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Ready Player One and noted the undercurrent of sadness present in the film, stating that ""I don\'t think Spielberg gets enough credit for making sad films that most people interpret as happy, and complex films that are immediately dismissed as simple or confused"". Seitz concluded that the film ""is a mess, but it is a fascinating and complex one..."" In March 2019, a year after the film\'s release, Seitz determined that with Ready Player One\'s images commenting on capitalism and popular culture, the film was the second-most ""interesting substantive"" big-budgeted fantasy in 2018 after Black Panther, admitting that ""I still think about a lot, especially concerning the world around me.""\r\nMonica Castillo was more critical of the film in her review for The Guardian and drew attention to the absence of character arcs, the lack of resolution for plot holes in the novel, and the bloating of scenes in the film by trivia. Alonso Duralde, writing for TheWrap, found the usage of pop culture references lacking, and found his experience watching the film as ""feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past. I\'ve never been much of a video-game player, but by the finale, I was ready to \'Leeroy Jenkins!\' my way out of the theater"".\r\nAccolades\r\nSequel\r\nWhen asked about a sequel to the film, Cline stated: ""I think there\'s a good chance that, if this one does well, Warner Bros. will want to make a sequel. I don\'t know if Steven would want to dive back in, because he would know what he is getting into. He\'s said that it\'s the third-hardest film he\'s made, out of dozens and dozens of movies"". Co-star Olivia Cooke, and presumably the rest of the cast, is ""contracted to sequels"". Cline wrote a book sequel, titled Ready Player Two, which was released on November 24, 2020, stating in the acknowledgments that he had consulted Spielberg on the final draft of the book and where to take an adaptation. On December 22, 2020, Cline announced that a sequel was in the early stages of development.', 'html': '<p>Ready Player One is a 2018 American science fiction action film based on Ernest Cline\'s novel of the same name.

As the scenes developed, we got an understanding of how many characters we needed.</blockquote><p>Part of the film takes place in a virtual space based on the Overlook Hotel in the film The Shining. This was mostly a digital recreation using high-quality telecine of the original film, allowing new camera angles and shots that did not appear in the original. Some original footage from The Shining was also used, with ILM\'s modifications. Only a few scenes in this sequence involved real actors (such as the appearance of the Grady twins) and required reproduction of The Shining\'s physical sets. The Shining sequence was post-processed with film grain and other aging effects to make the new footage closely resemble the original. During the production of Ready Player One, The VFX team built the sequence the Overlook Hotel in the digital realm. Stanley Kubrick\'s blueprints were used to recreate the hotel in the film. ILM also had to produce digital versions of the film\'s many cultural references, including the DeLorean time machine (from the Back to the Future films); the Iron Giant; Chucky; and King Kong, modeled after the 1933 film version. The Tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park was created from the base model ILM had created. Digital Domain facilitated pre-visualization (with The Third Floor), motion capture, and virtual sets, and also created 300 visual effects shots for the primarily live-action portions of the film. The virtual sets were powered by game engines and were used congruently with the motion-capture process, with previsualization supervisor Scott Meadows explaining that in real time Spielberg would ""put on a headset and scout the sets and make adjustments.""</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>On June 9, 2016, John Williams was initially going to compose the film\'s score. However, in July 2017, Williams left the project in favor of scoring Spielberg\'s The Post, and Alan Silvestri took over scoring duties for the film. The official score was released by WaterTower Music as a two-CD set on March 30, 2018, with vinyl and cassette releases projected. At Spielberg\'s request, Silvestri references his own music from Back to the Future within the film\'s score, as well as quoting music written by other composers including Max Steiner\'s theme from King Kong, Akira Ifukube’s main theme from Godzilla, and the score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind from The Shining.</p><br/><h3>Cultural references</h3><p>Ready Player One pays homage to popular culture from various time periods, mainly the 1970s and 1980s but also extending to the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s; reviewers have identified over a hundred references to films, television shows, music, toys, video games, anime, and comics from these eras. Cline did not have any issues with these copyrighted elements when he published the book, but was aware that securing all necessary rights would be a major obstacle for a film adaptation. This task was eventually made easier thanks to Spielberg\'s reputation in the film industry. In the end, Spielberg estimated that they managed to get about 80% of the copyrighted elements they desired. The production was not able to secure Close Encounters of the Third Kind from Columbia Pictures.</p><p>The Dungeons & Dragons module Tomb of Horrors features in an important episode of the book, the ""Copper Key challenge"", but that reference was excluded from the film, where the challenge features a huge car race in New York instead. However, the movie does reference the module: artwork of the Tomb of Horrors demon appears on the back of Aech\'s van.</p><p>Similarly Blade Runner, which was integral to the plot of the book, was shelved as Blade Runner 2049 was in production at the same time as Ready Player One and the producers at Alcon Entertainment feared that Spielberg\'s film could damage the commercial prospects of their film; as a replacement, the creative team had the players play through the events of The Shining, which Spielberg was able to secure the rights to as an homage to his friend Stanley Kubrick. Penn and Cline also thought that the film could be the opportunity to replace such a lengthy sequence with a more action-heavy one. Once they decided to use The Shining, they were doubtful at first that Spielberg would accept the change, but Spielberg did go for it. While Cline\'s original work heavily used the character of Ultraman, the rights over the character were still under legal dispute, requiring them to replace Ultraman with the titular robot from The Iron Giant and RX-78-2 Gundam. Spielberg recognized that his past films were a significant part of the 1980s popular culture cited in the book, and to avoid being accused of ""vanity"", he opted to remove many of the references to his own work. Cline stated that he believed Spielberg wanted to avoid self-references to films he directed, due to the criticism he received for his film 1941, which lampooned his own previous works Jaws and Duel. Cline said he had to convince Spielberg to include some iconic elements, such as the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, which Spielberg conceded as the film was one he produced rather than directed. Spielberg also allowed the Tyrannosaurus rex from his own Jurassic Park to be included. Cline also asked ILM to include a reference to Last Action Hero, one of Penn\'s first screenplays, without Penn\'s knowledge; a movie marquee in the Manhattan race segment bears the name ""Jack Slater"", the character Arnold Schwarzenegger played in that film.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Ready Player One was originally scheduled to be released on December 15, 2017. However, on February 9, 2016, the film was delayed to March 30, 2018, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. In January 2018, it was announced the film\'s release date had been moved up one day to March 29, 2018. The film had its world premiere at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018 (as part of the South by Southwest Film Festival). Warner Bros. distributed the film worldwide, with Village Roadshow Pictures distributing in several overseas territories. Around the same time the film was released, massively multi-player online game platform Roblox held an event based on it. The winner of the event was the user r0cu.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Ready Player One was released on digital copy on July 3, 2018, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 24, 2018. The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart, a tracker of combined domestic Blu-Ray and DVD unit sales, for the week ending on July 27, 2018. It retained the No. 1 spot on the chart for the week ending on August 4, 2018.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>Ready Player One grossed $137.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $445.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $583 million. Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film needed to gross at least $440 million in order to break even.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, Ready Player One was projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,100 theaters over its first four days. It made $12.1 million on its first day, including $3.75 million from Wednesday night previews. It ended up grossing $41.8 million in its opening weekend (for a four-day total of $53.7 million). The film made $24.6 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomer A Quiet Place, and $11.5 million in its third weekend, finishing in fourth.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 444 reviews. The site\'s critical consensus reads, ""Ready Player One is a sweetly nostalgic thrill ride that neatly encapsulates Spielberg\'s strengths while adding another solidly engrossing adventure to his filmography."" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 82% overall positive score and a 65% ""definite recommend"".</p><p>In a review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote that the film\'s ""overwhelming"" nature and non-stop action will likely thrill fans of pop culture; while he observed narrative weaknesses, such as a lack of depth among the supporting characters, he felt that they ultimately do not hinder the film from working ""on the level of technical, blockbuster mastery that Spielberg helped define"". Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called the film a ""coruscating explosion of pop-culture eye candy"" and found the sequence based on The Shining to be ""irresistible"". However, he criticized Spielberg\'s separation of fantasy and reality, and he said the film has ""more activity than it does layers"". IndieWire\'s Eric Kohn characterized the film as ""an astonishing sci-fi spectacle and a relentless nostalgia trip at once"" and praised both the sequence based on The Shining and Penn\'s screenplay, particularly with respect to Mendelsohn\'s character. Nevertheless, he remarked that the film ""drags a bunch in its final third"". Alissa Wilkinson, writing for Vox, praised both the quality and quantity of the worldbuilding. She also commented on just how dystopian the future portrayed is, where the main characters fight to save the OASIS and the escape from reality it represents, with arguably less concern for the problems of the real world. Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Ready Player One and noted the undercurrent of sadness present in the film, stating that ""I don\'t think Spielberg gets enough credit for making sad films that most people interpret as happy, and complex films that are immediately dismissed as simple or confused"". Seitz concluded that the film ""is a mess, but it is a fascinating and complex one..."" In March 2019, a year after the film\'s release, Seitz determined that with Ready Player One\'s images commenting on capitalism and popular culture, the film was the second-most ""interesting substantive"" big-budgeted fantasy in 2018 after Black Panther, admitting that ""I still think about a lot, especially concerning the world around me.""</p><p>Monica Castillo was more critical of the film in her review for The Guardian and drew attention to the absence of character arcs, the lack of resolution for plot holes in the novel, and the bloating of scenes in the film by trivia. Alonso Duralde, writing for TheWrap, found the usage of pop culture references lacking, and found his experience watching the film as ""feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past. I\'ve never been much of a video-game player, but by the finale, I was ready to \'Leeroy Jenkins!\' my way out of the theater"".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=""table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100""><tbody><tr style=""background:#ccc; text-align:center;""><th scope=""col"">Award</th><th scope=""col"">Date of ceremony</th><th scope=""col"">Category</th><th scope=""col"">Recipient(s)</th><th scope=""col"">Result</th><th scope=""col"" class=""unsortable""><abbr title=""Reference(s)"">Ref(s)</abbr></th></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" rowspan=""4""><span>Teen Choice Awards</span></th><td rowspan=""4""><span>August 12, 2018</span></td><td><span>Choice Sci-Fi Movie</span></td><td><i>Ready Player One</i></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td><td rowspan=""4"" style=""text-align:center;""></td></tr><tr><td><span>Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor</span></td><td><span>Tye Sheridan</span></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actress</span></td><td rowspan=""2""><span>Olivia Cooke</span></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td>Choice Breakout Movie Star</td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><th scope=""row""><span>Critics\' Choice Movie Awards</span></th><td><span>January 13, 2019</span></td><td><span>Best Visual Effects</span></td><td><i>Ready Player One</i></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td><td style=""text-align:center;""></td></tr><tr><th scope=""row"" rowspan=""5""><span class=""mw-redirect"">Visual Effects Society Awards</span></th><td rowspan=""5""><span>February 5, 2019</span></td><td>Outstanding Visual Effects in a<br>Photoreal Feature</td><td><span>Roger Guyett</span>, Jennifer Meislohn, <span>Dave Shirk</span>,<br><span>Matthew E.

I don\'t know if Steven would want to dive back in, because he would know what he is getting into. He\'s said that it\'s the third-hardest film he\'s made, out of dozens and dozens of movies"". Co-star Olivia Cooke, and presumably the rest of the cast, is ""contracted to sequels"". Cline wrote a book sequel, titled Ready Player Two, which was released on November 24, 2020, stating in the acknowledgments that he had consulted Spielberg on the final draft of the book and where to take an adaptation. On December 22, 2020, Cline announced that a sequel was in the early stages of development.</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt1677720', 'title': 'Ready Player One', 'fullTitle': 'Ready

Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\r\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Tony Stark (Downey), Steve Rogers (Evans), Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Natasha Romanoff in March 2009 and Renner as Clint Barton in June 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September.

The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score, and garnered numerous awards and nominations including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements in visual effects. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019)."", 'html': ""<p>Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor\'s brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\r\nThe film\'s development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Tony Stark (Downey), Steve Rogers (Evans), Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel\'s previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Natasha Romanoff in March 2009 and Renner as Clint Barton in June 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\r\nThe Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the last film of Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon\'s direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score, and garnered numerous awards and nominations including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements in visual effects. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\r\nPlot\r\nThe Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.\r\nIn response, Fury reactivates the ""Avengers Initiative"". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him check Selvig\'s research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract\'s power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki\'s surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.\r\nThe Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue, Loki\'s agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk\'s rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki\'s mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson\'s death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\r\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of New York City, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki\'s mind control, reveals that Loki\'s scepter can shut down the generator. Fury\'s superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark\'s suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.\r\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth.\r\nCast\r\nRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers. He said he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: ""Well, I said, \'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don\'t know what you\'re thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.\' He was like, \'Okay, let\'s try that.\' We tried it and it didn\'t work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."" About the character\'s evolution from previous films, Downey said, ""In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In The Avengers, he\'s throwing it down with the others"". Downey earned $50 million from the film, ""once box-office bonuses and backend compensation factored in"".\r\nChris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to The Avengers. Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers: ""It\'s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You\'ve got to imagine, it\'s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you\'re in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they\'re all dead. He\'s just lonely. I think in the beginning it\'s a fish-out-of-water scene, and it\'s tough. It\'s a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world."" Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, ""I think there\'s certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they\'re polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it\'s pretty fun."" Evans earned $2–3 million for the film.\r\nMark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: A genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk (2008) before Edward Norton took the role, was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down. About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, ""I\'m a friend of Ed\'s, and yeah, that wasn\'t a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation\'s Hamlet."" About the character, he said, ""He\'s a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities"". Regarding the Hulk\'s place on the team, Ruffalo said, ""He\'s like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He\'s a loose cannon. It\'s like, \'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let\'s hope it turns out well!"" This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told New York magazine, ""I\'m really excited. No one\'s ever played the Hulk exactly; they\'ve always done CGI. They\'re going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I\'ll actually play the Hulk. That\'ll be fun"". The 3D model used to create the Hulk\'s body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk\'s face was modeled after Ruffalo. To create the Hulk\'s voice, Ruffalo\'s voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others; however, the Hulk\'s only speaking line (""Puny god."") was provided solely by Ruffalo. Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for the film.\r\nChris Hemsworth as Thor: The crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal. He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor (2011) by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, ""My body weight in protein pretty much!"" He remarked that Thor\'s motivation ""is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it\'s his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it\'s some bad guy who they\'ve gotta take down. It\'s a different approach for me, or for Thor. He\'s constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it\'s his little brother there. . . I\'ve been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I\'m the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There\'s a bit of that."" Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for the film.\r\nScarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D. About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, ""Our characters have a long history. They\'ve fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We\'re the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She\'s not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She\'s there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal"". Regarding her training, Johansson said, ""Even though Iron Man 2 was \'one-for-them,\' I\'d never done anything like that before. I\'d never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For The Avengers, I\'ve spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it\'s crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time."" Johansson earned $4–6 million for the film.\r\nJeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye: A master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation. About the role, Renner said, ""When I saw Iron Man, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn\'t really a superhero; he\'s just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that."" Regarding Hawkeye\'s sniper mentality, Renner said, ""It\'s a lonely game. He\'s an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett\'s character, Natasha. It\'s like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission."" Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. ""Quite the opposite, he\'s the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero."" Renner earned $2–3 million for the film.\r\nTom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor\'s adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. About his character\'s evolution from the film Thor, Hiddleston said, ""I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers, he\'s seen a few things."" About Loki\'s motivations, Hiddleston said, ""At the beginning of The Avengers, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven\'t let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.""\r\nClark Gregg as Phil Coulson: An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division\'s field operations. Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel. Gregg said his role was expanded in The Avengers: "" Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn\'t the real script. But it wasn\'t, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years."" Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character\'s backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.\r\nCobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury. Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin. Smulders\' deal would integrate her into nine films. Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, ""I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don\'t do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn\'t offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to."" On relating to the character, Smulders said, ""I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We\'re asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.""\r\nStellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig: An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki\'s control who is studying the Tesseract\'s power. Regarding Loki\'s control over Selvig, Skarsgård said, ""Well with the scene we did in Thor, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik\'s mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik\'s mind."" About his role, he said, "" is of importance but the size of the role is not big.""\r\nSamuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury: The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the ""Avengers Initiative"". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films. Jackson said he does more in The Avengers than in any of the previous films: ""You don\'t have to wait until the end of the movie to see me"". About the role, Jackson said, ""It\'s always good to play somebody is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem."" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in Jackie Brown, calling him ""a nice guy to hang out with. You just don\'t want to cross him"". Jackson earned $4–6 million for the film.\r\nGwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernández reprise their roles from previous MCU films as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively. Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays ""the Other"", and Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene. Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance in a news report. Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff\'s interrogator. Warren Kole has a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playing Galaga. Enver Gjokaj, who later went on to play Daniel Sousa in the series Agent Carter, appears as a police officer.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\n""It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes to The Ultimates, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it\'s ridiculous. There\'s a thunder god, there\'s a green \'id\' giant rage monster, there\'s Captain America from the 40s, there\'s Tony Stark who definitely doesn\'t get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don\'t belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film.""\r\n—Joss Whedon, director of The Avengers, about the film.\r\nIdeas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio\'s intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006, and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.\r\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey\'s signing. Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would ""definitely have input and a say"". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, ""It\'s going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you\'re going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it\'s going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we\'ve created"". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The following day, Marvel announced that the film\'s release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film\'s cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.\r\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, ""My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we\'re mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There\'s just a board that tracks \'Here\'s where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie\'. . . I\'m pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we\'re all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority"". At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor\'s role in the script because he had doubts about the character\'s ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor. The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using Red Skull.\r\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. ""No,"" he said, ""because we\'re doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski Thor. We\'re not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe, there\'s a race called the Asgardians. And we\'re linked through this Tree of Life that we\'re unaware of. It\'s real science, but we don\'t know about it yet. The \'Thor\' movie is about teaching people that"". In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.\r\nPre-production\r\n""People forget that we started filming Avengers before either Thor or Captain America were released. What if people hated Thor? What if people thought Loki was ridiculous? What if people didn\'t buy this super soldier frozen in ice? We were in the first quarter of production on a giant movie at that time, and we weren\'t going to stop. It was sort of all in at that point.""\r\n—Kevin Feige, President of Production for Marvel Studios, on the challenges of producing the first Avengers film.\r\nBy April 2010, Joss Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn\'s script, and was officially announced in July 2010. On the hiring, Arad stated: ""My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer It\'s part of his life so you know he is going to protect it I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better"". Feige added, ""I\'ve known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is."" Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how ""these people shouldn\'t be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family"".\r\nWhen Whedon received Penn\'s draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not ""have anything"" and they should ""pretend this draft never happened"". Part of Whedon\'s issue was the lack of character connections in Penn\'s draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin ""at square one"". Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline ""Avengers: Some Assembly Required"", riffing on the ""Avengers Assemble"" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release. The script would go through ""a lot of insane iterations of what might be"" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he ""wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp"", and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character. He also was ""worried that one British character actor was not enough to take on Earth\'s mightiest heroes, and that we\'d feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane\'s son, in it."" Once all of the actors were ""locked in place the movie stayed on mission."" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt ""these guys just don\'t belong together"" before realizing their interactions could be like The Dirty Dozen (1967). Whedon also referenced Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Abyss (1989), His Girl Friday (1940), and Black Hawk Down (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he ""fought"" for sole credit and was ""very upset about it."" Penn felt the two ""could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.""\r\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. ""We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers,"" stated Feige. ""Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks."" In response, Norton\'s agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige\'s statement, calling it ""purposefully misleading"" and an ""inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light"". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he ""wanted more diversity"" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.\r\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, ""Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque."" Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 (2013) and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company\'s production logo on marketing materials and the film\'s opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads ""Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures"" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount\'s Epix retained pay TV rights.\r\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D\'Esposito announced The Avengers would film primarily in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan, but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson\'s State of the City address that The Avengers would film in Cleveland.\r\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man\'s Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that ""Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the \'cool\' factor of the suitcase suit, while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle."" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in Iron Man 2 as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in Iron Man and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack. The Science & Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film.\r\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill, after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury\'s sidekick. Over the successive months, the film\'s cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård, Paul Bettany, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow was cast at Downey\'s insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes\' individual films, commenting, ""You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.""\r\nFilming\r\nPrincipal photography began on April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Albuquerque Studios, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world\'s largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.\r\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming took place over a period of four weeks. The city\'s East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City\'s 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, ""It\'s easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms. The director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging"". Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station\'s Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland. Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge. Public Square\'s southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.\r\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days. Locations there included Park Avenue and Central Park. For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to ""get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn\'t look too computer-generated"". ""We\'re getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,"" Morrison explained, ""but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.""\r\nCinematographer Seamus McGarvey stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to cope with the main characters\' varying heights, explaining, ""shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important."" The film was McGarvey\'s first venture with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots, and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, ""Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a \'comic book look\' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.""\r\nPost-production\r\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, ""I\'m not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I\'m in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years."" Whedon also said that ""there definitely are movies that shouldn\'t be in 3D"" but ""The Avengers isn\'t obnoxiously 3D. There\'s no, \'Oh look, we\'re going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it\'s in 3D!\' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it\'s an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway"". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opened in regular theaters. The IMAX release followed Marvel\'s IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.\r\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. ""He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He\'s the great grand daddy of the badasses and he\'s in love with Death and I just think that\'s so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki\'s work and I was like \'It\'s got to be Thanos.\' And they said \'Okay\' and I\'m like \'Oh my God!\'"" An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film\'s release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley\'s arms in the Angel episode, ""A Hole in the World"". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, ""went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day\'s events,"" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.\r\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film\'s key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements. Jeff White, ILM\'s visual effects supervisor, aimed for a ""less cartoony"" depiction of the Hulk compared to the one the firm created for Ang Lee\'s 2003 film, stating, ""We really wanted to utilize everything we\'ve developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.""\r\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks. Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building\'s likeness in the area ILM needed. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.\r\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta\'s visual effects supervisor, said, ""We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it\'s hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different."" Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man\'s reflective metal surfaces.\r\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, ""We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space"" including Loki\'s arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier\'s bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark\'s penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other. Method Design in Los Angeles created the film\'s closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, ""This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of The Avengers as well as 30 credits set in-scene.""\r\nMusic\r\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, ""I\'ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it\'s a very different situation. It\'s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together."" Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, ""The score is very old-fashioned, which is why was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the school of \'I\'m just feeling a lot right now!\' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.""\r\nIn March 2012, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for its single ""Hello Andheron"", which serves as the theme song for the film\'s Indian release. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, Avengers Assemble, on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.\r\nMarketing\r\nTrailers\r\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast. In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International after studio executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production. In July 2011, a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post-credits scene of Captain America: The First Avenger was briefly leaked online. Entertainment Weekly speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as ""shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone"".\r\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios\' upcoming film slate, which included The Avengers, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members. Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel\'s executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.\r\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, ""The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie\'s premise"" and is ""heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses of Iron Man\'s new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.\'s Tony Stark gets the best lines"". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, ""Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn\'t seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer"". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website\'s record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011), 21 Jump Street (2012), and The Hunger Games (2012).\r\nIn January 2012, Marvel Studios held a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon, cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg and a 10-second tease of the 30-second Super Bowl commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February. According to the Los Angeles Times, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot. On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film\'s theatrical release.\r\nTie-in comics\r\nIn December 2011, Marvel announced that an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie-in, Black Widow Strikes written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from Iron Man 2. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers lineup as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.\r\nPromotional partners\r\nPaul Gitter, Marvel Entertainment\'s president of consumer products, commented that the build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: ""Retailers have been less tolerant with films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace"".\r\nIn September 2011, set photos of Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura were published online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company\'s involvement with the film, ""As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can\'t say any more about it at this time."" In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.\r\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Marvel has partnered with fragrance company JADS to promote The Avengers with character-based fragrances. The announcement was just ahead of the Toy Industry Association\'s annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products. Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O\'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include Baskin-Robbins, Burger King, and Dunkin\' Donuts, who had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney does not generally promote through fast food outlets.\r\nVideo game\r\nA video game based on the film was planned for concurrent release. The game was to be a first-person shooter/brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows and published by THQ, with THQ Studio Australia developing the console versions and Blue Tongue Entertainment the PC version. After THQ closed both studios, the game was canceled. Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.\r\nIn May 2012, Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment announced that they were partnering to develop a motion-controlled game titled Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. The game was inspired by the ""Secret Invasion"" storyline and features 20 different characters. Marvel also announced a four-chapter mobile game titled Avengers Initiative, with one chapter focusing on each of Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nIn February 2012, Disney announced that the film\'s title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name, as well as its 1998 film adaptation. This led to confusion over the film\'s actual title. Empire magazine reported that the film would be titled Marvel Avengers Assemble while The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be called simply Avengers Assemble. Marvel\'s UK website refers to the film as Marvel\'s Avengers Assemble, although David Cox of The Guardian, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer. According to the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office, the title is Marvel Avengers Assemble. Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, ""The Avengers — formally titled Marvel\'s The Avengers onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on"". Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that ""decisions like that aren\'t made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it"".\r\nThe film\'s world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood\'s El Capitan Theatre. The Avengers closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28. The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700. The Avengers was the last film released in Phase One of the MCU.\r\nHome media\r\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets. Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new Marvel One-Shot titled Item 47 (2012) and ""a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process"" including ""a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders"" and ""some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury\'s interaction with the World Security Council"".\r\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled ""Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled"" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on April 2, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.\r\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon\'s audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson\'s death from the film\'s theatrical version. Disney\'s UK division said the ""less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson\'s confrontation with Loki"" occurred because ""ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region\'s elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release"".\r\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe Avengers grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release. The film\'s worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the fourth-largest. The Avengers also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record previously set by Avatar (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.\r\nUnited States and Canada\r\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film based on comics. It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, on around 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, and earned $80.8 million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross. The film\'s Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million). It also set a Saturday- and Sunday-gross record ($69.6 million and $57.1 million respectively). In total, it earned a total of $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record, including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million). The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 60% of the audience male, 55% couples, 24% families, and 21% teenagers. Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater), the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million, and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day). It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends. The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.\r\nRecords\r\nThe following are records set by the film upon its theatrical release.\r\n* While eight films have reached $100 million after two days, the film\'s gross by the end of the second day exceeded all of them.\r\nOther territories\r\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film, the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing superhero film. It opened Wednesday, April 25, 2012, in 10 countries, earning $17.1 million. It opened in 29 more countries on April 26 and 27, earning $73.1 million in three days. Through Sunday, April 29, it earned an opening-weekend total of $185.1 million from 39 countries. It was in first place at the box office for four consecutive weekends. The film set opening-day records in New Zealand, Malaysia, and Iceland, a single-day record in the Philippines, as well as both single- and opening-day records in Singapore and in Thailand. It also earned the second-highest-grossing opening day in Australia ($6.2 million), behind Deathly Hallows – Part 2, in Mexico, in the Philippines, and in Vietnam. It set opening-weekend records in many territories, including Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Peru, and Central America. It also earned the second largest five-day opening in Australia ($20.2 million).\r\nIn the United Kingdom, the film earned £2.5 million ($4.1 million) on its opening day and £15.8 million ($25.7 million) during the weekend, setting an opening-weekend record for a superhero film. It became the market\'s highest-grossing superhero film. In Latin America, it became the highest-grossing film ($207 million) and the first film to earn more than $200 million. It also became the highest-grossing film in the Philippines, in Singapore, and in Indonesia. As of February 2021, the film\'s top international markets were China ($83 million), United Kingdom ($80.5 million), Brazil ($63.9 million), Mexico ($61.7 million), and Australia ($54.5 million).\r\nCritical response\r\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, with an average score of 8.1/10, based on 363 reviews. The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes\' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare ""A+"" grade on an ""A+ to F"" scale.\r\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film, remarking, ""It\'s clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone\'s seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again."" To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. ""It\'s also the blockbuster,"" Travers said, ""I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It\'s Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor."" Justin Chang of Variety wrote, ""Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon\'s buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story."" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film\'s frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it ""provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable"". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that ""while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.""\r\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo\'s portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; ""Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano."" Similarly, The New Yorker\'s Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo\'s acting to be one of the film\'s highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice\'s Karina Longworth concluded: ""Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself."" Travers asserted that the actor resonated a ""scruffy warmth and humor"" vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that ""the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he\'s at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He\'s a lot more fun in small doses.)""\r\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey\'s performance—favored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: ""His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony."" Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character\'s internal conflicts.\r\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script ""sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they\'re well fleshed-out underneath."" Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film Rio Bravo (1959). Longworth felt that while Whedon\'s script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it ""in a substantive way"".\r\nAccolades\r\nThe Avengers has garnered numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. The film has also been nominated for three Critics\' Choice Movie Awards, thirteen People\'s Choice Awards (winning three), eleven Teen Choice Awards (winning two), six Saturn Awards (winning four), and six VES Awards (winning two), as well as the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form. In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine\'s poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.\r\nSequels\r\nAvengers: Age of Ultron, was written and directed by Whedon, and released on May 1, 2015. Much of the cast returns, with the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron. Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Infinity War was released on April 27, 2018, and the sequel on April 26, 2019. Much of the cast returns for Infinity War with additional cast and characters joining from other MCU films.', 'html': '<p>Marvel\'s The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name.

In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor\'s brother Loki from subjugating Earth.</p><p>The film\'s development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Tony Stark (Downey), Steve Rogers (Evans), Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel\'s previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Natasha Romanoff in March 2009 and Renner as Clint Barton in June 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.</p><p>The Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the last film of Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon\'s direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score, and garnered numerous awards and nominations including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements in visual effects. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.</p><p>In response, Fury reactivates the ""Avengers Initiative"". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him check Selvig\'s research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract\'s power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki\'s surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.</p><p>The Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue, Loki\'s agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk\'s rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki\'s mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson\'s death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of New York City, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki\'s mind control, reveals that Loki\'s scepter can shut down the generator. Fury\'s superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark\'s suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.</p><p>In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: A self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included Iron Man 2 (2010) and The Avengers. He said he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: ""Well, I said, \'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don\'t know what you\'re thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.\' He was like, \'Okay, let\'s try that.\' We tried it and it didn\'t work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."" About the character\'s evolution from previous films, Downey said, ""In Iron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. Iron Man 2 is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In The Avengers, he\'s throwing it down with the others"". Downey earned $50 million from the film, ""once box-office bonuses and backend compensation factored in"".</li><li>Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: A World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to The Avengers. Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in The Avengers: ""It\'s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You\'ve got to imagine, it\'s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you\'re in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they\'re all dead. He\'s just lonely. I think in the beginning it\'s a fish-out-of-water scene, and it\'s tough. It\'s a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world."" Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, ""I think there\'s certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they\'re polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it\'s pretty fun."" Evans earned $2–3 million for the film.</li><li>Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: A genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in The Incredible Hulk (2008) before Edward Norton took the role, was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down. About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, ""I\'m a friend of Ed\'s, and yeah, that wasn\'t a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation\'s Hamlet."" About the character, he said, ""He\'s a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities"". Regarding the Hulk\'s place on the team, Ruffalo said, ""He\'s like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He\'s a loose cannon. It\'s like, \'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let\'s hope it turns out well!"" This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told New York magazine, ""I\'m really excited. No one\'s ever played the Hulk exactly; they\'ve always done CGI. They\'re going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I\'ll actually play the Hulk. That\'ll be fun"". The 3D model used to create the Hulk\'s body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk\'s face was modeled after Ruffalo. To create the Hulk\'s voice, Ruffalo\'s voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others; however, the Hulk\'s only speaking line (""Puny god."") was provided solely by Ruffalo. Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for the film.</li><li>Chris Hemsworth as Thor: The crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal. He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor (2011) by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, ""My body weight in protein pretty much!"" He remarked that Thor\'s motivation ""is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it\'s his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it\'s some bad guy who they\'ve gotta take down. It\'s a different approach for me, or for Thor. He\'s constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it\'s his little brother there. . . I\'ve been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I\'m the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There\'s a bit of that."" Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for the film.</li><li>Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D. About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, ""Our characters have a long history. They\'ve fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We\'re the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She\'s not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She\'s there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal"". Regarding her training, Johansson said, ""Even though Iron Man 2 was \'one-for-them,\' I\'d never done anything like that before. I\'d never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For The Avengers, I\'ve spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it\'s crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time."" Johansson earned $4–6 million for the film.</li><li>Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye: A master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation. About the role, Renner said, ""When I saw Iron Man, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn\'t really a superhero; he\'s just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that."" Regarding Hawkeye\'s sniper mentality, Renner said, ""It\'s a lonely game. He\'s an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett\'s character, Natasha. It\'s like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission."" Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. ""Quite the opposite, he\'s the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero."" Renner earned $2–3 million for the film.</li><li>Tom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor\'s adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. About his character\'s evolution from the film Thor, Hiddleston said, ""I think the Loki we see in The Avengers is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in The Avengers, he\'s seen a few things."" About Loki\'s motivations, Hiddleston said, ""At the beginning of The Avengers, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven\'t let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.""</li><li>Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson: An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division\'s field operations. Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel. Gregg said his role was expanded in The Avengers: "" Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn\'t the real script. But it wasn\'t, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years."" Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character\'s backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.</li><li>Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury. Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin. Smulders\' deal would integrate her into nine films. Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, ""I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don\'t do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn\'t offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to."" On relating to the character, Smulders said, ""I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We\'re asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.""</li><li>Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig: An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki\'s control who is studying the Tesseract\'s power. Regarding Loki\'s control over Selvig, Skarsgård said, ""Well with the scene we did in Thor, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik\'s mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik\'s mind."" About his role, he said, "" is of importance but the size of the role is not big.""</li><li>Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury: The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the ""Avengers Initiative"". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films. Jackson said he does more in The Avengers than in any of the previous films: ""You don\'t have to wait until the end of the movie to see me"". About the role, Jackson said, ""It\'s always good to play somebody is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem."" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in Jackie Brown, calling him ""a nice guy to hang out with. You just don\'t want to cross him"". Jackson earned $4–6 million for the film.</li></ul><p>Gwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernández reprise their roles from previous MCU films as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively. Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays ""the Other"", and Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene. Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley. Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance in a news report. Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff\'s interrogator. Warren Kole has a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playing Galaga. Enver Gjokaj, who later went on to play Daniel Sousa in the series Agent Carter, appears as a police officer.</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><blockquote>""It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes to The Ultimates, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it\'s ridiculous. There\'s a thunder god, there\'s a green \'id\' giant rage monster, there\'s Captain America from the 40s, there\'s Tony Stark who definitely doesn\'t get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don\'t belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film.""</blockquote><p>—Joss Whedon, director of The Avengers, about the film.</p><p>Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio\'s intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006, and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.</p><p>Casting began in October 2008 with Downey\'s signing. Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man 2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would ""definitely have input and a say"". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, ""It\'s going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you\'re going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it\'s going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we\'ve created"". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The following day, Marvel announced that the film\'s release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film\'s cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.</p><p>In July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, ""My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we\'re mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There\'s just a board that tracks \'Here\'s where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie\'. . . I\'m pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we\'re all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority"". At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor\'s role in the script because he had doubts about the character\'s ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor. The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using Red Skull.</p><p>In January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. ""No,"" he said, ""because we\'re doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski Thor. We\'re not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library Thor. And in the Thor of the Marvel Universe, there\'s a race called the Asgardians. And we\'re linked through this Tree of Life that we\'re unaware of. It\'s real science, but we don\'t know about it yet. The \'Thor\' movie is about teaching people that"". In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies. Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including The Avengers.</p><h4>Pre-production</h4><blockquote>""People forget that we started filming Avengers before either Thor or Captain America were released. What if people hated Thor? What if people thought Loki was ridiculous? What if people didn\'t buy this super soldier frozen in ice? We were in the first quarter of production on a giant movie at that time, and we weren\'t going to stop. It was sort of all in at that point.""</blockquote><p>—Kevin Feige, President of Production for Marvel Studios, on the challenges of producing the first Avengers film.</p><p>By April 2010, Joss Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn\'s script, and was officially announced in July 2010. On the hiring, Arad stated: ""My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer It\'s part of his life so you know he is going to protect it I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better"". Feige added, ""I\'ve known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is."" Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how ""these people shouldn\'t be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family"".</p><p>When Whedon received Penn\'s draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not ""have anything"" and they should ""pretend this draft never happened"". Part of Whedon\'s issue was the lack of character connections in Penn\'s draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin ""at square one"". Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline ""Avengers: Some Assembly Required"", riffing on the ""Avengers Assemble"" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release. The script would go through ""a lot of insane iterations of what might be"" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he ""wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp"", and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character. He also was ""worried that one British character actor was not enough to take on Earth\'s mightiest heroes, and that we\'d feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane\'s son, in it."" Once all of the actors were ""locked in place the movie stayed on mission."" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt ""these guys just don\'t belong together"" before realizing their interactions could be like The Dirty Dozen (1967). Whedon also referenced Dr. Strangelove (1964), The Abyss (1989), His Girl Friday (1940), and Black Hawk Down (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he ""fought"" for sole credit and was ""very upset about it."" Penn felt the two ""could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.""</p><p>The casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. ""We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers,"" stated Feige. ""Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks."" In response, Norton\'s agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige\'s statement, calling it ""purposefully misleading"" and an ""inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light"". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he ""wanted more diversity"" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.</p><p>In August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, ""Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque."" Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 (2013) and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company\'s production logo on marketing materials and the film\'s opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads ""Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures"" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount\'s Epix retained pay TV rights.</p><p>In December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D\'Esposito announced The Avengers would film primarily in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan, but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson\'s State of the City address that The Avengers would film in Cleveland.</p><p>Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Man\'s Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that ""Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the \'cool\' factor of the suitcase suit, while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle."" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in Iron Man 2 as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in Iron Man and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack. The Science & Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film.</p><p>Casting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill, after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury\'s sidekick. Over the successive months, the film\'s cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård, Paul Bettany, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Paltrow was cast at Downey\'s insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes\' individual films, commenting, ""You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.""</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Principal photography began on April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Albuquerque Studios, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world\'s largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.</p><p>Production relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming took place over a period of four weeks. The city\'s East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City\'s 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, ""It\'s easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms. The director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging"". Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station\'s Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland. Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge. Public Square\'s southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.</p><p>Principal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days. Locations there included Park Avenue and Central Park. For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to ""get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn\'t look too computer-generated"". ""We\'re getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,"" Morrison explained, ""but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.""</p><p>Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to cope with the main characters\' varying heights, explaining, ""shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important."" The film was McGarvey\'s first venture with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots, and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, ""Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a \'comic book look\' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.""</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>In December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, ""I\'m not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I\'m in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years."" Whedon also said that ""there definitely are movies that shouldn\'t be in 3D"" but ""The Avengers isn\'t obnoxiously 3D. There\'s no, \'Oh look, we\'re going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it\'s in 3D!\' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it\'s an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway"". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opened in regular theaters. The IMAX release followed Marvel\'s IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.</p><p>In a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. ""He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He\'s the great grand daddy of the badasses and he\'s in love with Death and I just think that\'s so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki\'s work and I was like \'It\'s got to be Thanos.\' And they said \'Okay\' and I\'m like \'Oh my God!\'"" An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film\'s release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley\'s arms in the Angel episode, ""A Hole in the World"". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, ""went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day\'s events,"" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.</p><p>The film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film\'s key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements. Jeff White, ILM\'s visual effects supervisor, aimed for a ""less cartoony"" depiction of the Hulk compared to the one the firm created for Ang Lee\'s 2003 film, stating, ""We really wanted to utilize everything we\'ve developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.""</p><p>ILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks. Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building\'s likeness in the area ILM needed. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.</p><p>Weta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta\'s visual effects supervisor, said, ""We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it\'s hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different."" Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man\'s reflective metal surfaces.</p><p>Scanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, ""We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space"" including Loki\'s arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier\'s bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark\'s penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other. Method Design in Los Angeles created the film\'s closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, ""This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of The Avengers as well as 30 credits set in-scene.""</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>In November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, ""I\'ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it\'s a very different situation. It\'s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together."" Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, ""The score is very old-fashioned, which is why was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the school of \'I\'m just feeling a lot right now!\' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.""</p><p>In March 2012, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for its single ""Hello Andheron"", which serves as the theme song for the film\'s Indian release. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, Avengers Assemble, on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><h4>Trailers</h4><p>The film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast. In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International after studio executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production. In July 2011, a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post-credits scene of Captain America: The First Avenger was briefly leaked online. Entertainment Weekly speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as ""shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone"".</p><p>In August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios\' upcoming film slate, which included The Avengers, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members. Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel\'s executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.</p><p>In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, ""The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie\'s premise"" and is ""heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses of Iron Man\'s new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.\'s Tony Stark gets the best lines"". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, ""Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn\'t seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer"". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website\'s record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011), 21 Jump Street (2012), and The Hunger Games (2012).</p><p>In January 2012, Marvel Studios held a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon, cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg and a 10-second tease of the 30-second Super Bowl commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February. According to the Los Angeles Times, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot. On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film\'s theatrical release.</p><h4>Tie-in comics</h4><p>In December 2011, Marvel announced that an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012. In February 2012, Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie-in, Black Widow Strikes written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote Captain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger. The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from Iron Man 2. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers lineup as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.</p><h4>Promotional partners</h4><p>Paul Gitter, Marvel Entertainment\'s president of consumer products, commented that the build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: ""Retailers have been less tolerant with films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace"".</p><p>In September 2011, set photos of Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura were published online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company\'s involvement with the film, ""As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for The Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can\'t say any more about it at this time."" In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for The Avengers would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.</p><p>In February 2012, it was announced that Marvel has partnered with fragrance company JADS to promote The Avengers with character-based fragrances. The announcement was just ahead of the Toy Industry Association\'s annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products. Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O\'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include Baskin-Robbins, Burger King, and Dunkin\' Donuts, who had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney does not generally promote through fast food outlets.</p><h4>Video game</h4><p>A video game based on the film was planned for concurrent release. The game was to be a first-person shooter/brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows and published by THQ, with THQ Studio Australia developing the console versions and Blue Tongue Entertainment the PC version. After THQ closed both studios, the game was canceled. Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.</p><p>In May 2012, Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment announced that they were partnering to develop a motion-controlled game titled Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. The game was inspired by the ""Secret Invasion"" storyline and features 20 different characters. Marvel also announced a four-chapter mobile game titled Avengers Initiative, with one chapter focusing on each of Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>In February 2012, Disney announced that the film\'s title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name, as well as its 1998 film adaptation. This led to confusion over the film\'s actual title. Empire magazine reported that the film would be titled Marvel Avengers Assemble while The Hollywood Reporter said that it would be called simply Avengers Assemble. Marvel\'s UK website refers to the film as Marvel\'s Avengers Assemble, although David Cox of The Guardian, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer. According to the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office, the title is Marvel Avengers Assemble. Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, ""The Avengers — formally titled Marvel\'s The Avengers onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on"". Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that ""decisions like that aren\'t made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it"".</p><p>The film\'s world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood\'s El Capitan Theatre. The Avengers closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28. The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700. The Avengers was the last film released in Phase One of the MCU.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>The film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets. Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new Marvel One-Shot titled Item 47 (2012) and ""a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process"" including ""a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders"" and ""some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury\'s interaction with the World Security Council"".</p><p>The film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled ""Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled"" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on April 2, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.</p><p>Some fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon\'s audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson\'s death from the film\'s theatrical version. Disney\'s UK division said the ""less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson\'s confrontation with Loki"" occurred because ""ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region\'s elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release"".</p><p>Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>The Avengers grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release. The film\'s worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the fourth-largest. The Avengers also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record previously set by Avatar (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release. It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.</p><h4>United States and Canada</h4><p>The film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film based on comics. It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, on around 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, and earned $80.8 million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross. The film\'s Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million). It also set a Saturday- and Sunday-gross record ($69.6 million and $57.1 million respectively). In total, it earned a total of $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record, including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million).

Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross. Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater), the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million, and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day). It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends. The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.</p><h4>Records</h4><p>The following are records set by the film upon its theatrical release.</p><table class=""table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100""><tbody><tr><th>Record title</th><th>Record detail</th><th>Reference</th></tr><tr><td>Opening weekend for any film</td><td>$207,438,708</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Opening week for any film</td><td>$270,019,373</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Opening weekend, adjusted for ticket pricing</td><td>$207.4 million</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Theater average – wide release</td><td>$47,698</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3D gross during opening weekend</td><td>$108 million</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>IMAX gross during opening weekend</td><td>$15.3 million</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Second weekend for any film</td><td>$103,052,274</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monthly share of domestic earnings</td><td>May 2012, 52%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highest cumulative gross</td><td>2 – 43 days</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Days to reach $100<sup class=""reference plainlinks nourlexpansion"" id=""ref_ninefig""><span>*</span></sup>, $150 million</td><td>2 days<sup class=""reference plainlinks nourlexpansion"" id=""ref_ninefig""><span>*</span></sup></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Days to reach $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450 million</td><td>3, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17 days respectively</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Days to reach $500, $550 million</td><td>23, 31 days</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May opening</td><td>$207,438,708</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Opening weekend for a superhero film</td><td>$207,438,708</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Highest-grossing superhero film</td><td>$623,357,910</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* While eight films have reached $100 million after two days, the film\'s gross by the end of the second day exceeded all of them.</p><h4>Other territories</h4><p>The film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film, the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing superhero film. It opened Wednesday, April 25, 2012, in 10 countries, earning $17.1 million. It opened in 29 more countries on April 26 and 27, earning $73.1 million in three days.

The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes\' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare ""A+"" grade on an ""A+ to F"" scale.</p><p>Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review of the film, remarking, ""It\'s clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone\'s seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again."" To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. ""It\'s also the blockbuster,"" Travers said, ""I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It\'s Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor."" Justin Chang of Variety wrote, ""Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon\'s buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story."" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film\'s frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it ""provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable"". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that ""while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.""</p><p>The performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo\'s portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; ""Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano."" Similarly, The New Yorker\'s Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo\'s acting to be one of the film\'s highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice\'s Karina Longworth concluded: ""Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself."" Travers asserted that the actor resonated a ""scruffy warmth and humor"" vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that ""the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he\'s at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He\'s a lot more fun in small doses.)""</p><p>Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey\'s performance—favored his work in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: ""His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony."" Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character\'s internal conflicts.</p><p>Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script ""sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they\'re well fleshed-out underneath."" Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film Rio Bravo (1959). Longworth felt that while Whedon\'s script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it ""in a substantive way"".</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>The Avengers has garnered numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. The film has also been nominated for three Critics\' Choice Movie Awards, thirteen People\'s Choice Awards (winning three), eleven Teen Choice Awards (winning two), six Saturn Awards (winning four), and six VES Awards (winning two), as well as the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form. In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in Empire magazine\'s poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.</p><br/><h3>Sequels</h3><p>Avengers: Age of Ultron, was written and directed by Whedon, and released on May 1, 2015. Much of the cast returns, with the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron.

The film is regarded as an homage to kaiju, mecha, and anime media.\r\nA sequel titled Pacific Rim: Uprising was released on March 23, 2018, with Universal Pictures distributing.\r\nPlot\r\nIn 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional portal called ""The Breach"" at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and attacking coastal cities. In response, humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers. Each is co-piloted by two or more people who share a mental link by a process called ""Drifting"" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.\r\nIn 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the American Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed ""Knifehead"". The Kaiju unexpectedly pierces the Jaeger\'s armor, ripping out half of its head and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the damaged Jaeger solo, kills Knifehead and walks Gipsy to shore before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of his brother and the stress of piloting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.\r\nFive years later, world leaders decide to cease funding for the Jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, since Kaiju are appearing more frequently and Jaegers are being destroyed as quickly as they are built. The walls are quickly proven to be ineffective. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under the command of Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to try to destroy the Breach using a tactical nuclear weapon, even though previous attempts to do so have failed.\r\nRaleigh, now working in wall construction, is recruited by Pentecost for the mission. Travelling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the director of the Jaeger\'s restoration program and Pentecost\'s adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation – the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, the Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka, piloted by father-and-son team, Herc and Chuck Hansen. To find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts and decides that Mako is ""drift-compatible"". During their first test, Raleigh falls out of alignment after reliving Yancy\'s death, causing Mako to become lost in the memory of a Kaiju attack on Tokyo, nearly firing Gipsy\'s energy cannon. As a result, Pentecost grounds Mako.\r\nPentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed. Newton suggests attempting to drift with a Kaiju\'s brain to learn more about them but is dismissed by his colleagues. He tries it regardless, discovering that Kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. Pentecost instructs Newton to find black market dealer Hannibal Chau to obtain another Kaiju brain to drift with it. Newton realizes the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and the two newest Kaiju to emerge, Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him in Hong Kong.\r\nAll Jaegers except Gipsy Danger are dispatched to intervene. The Kaijus destroy Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha, while Leatherback disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. As the only non-digital Jaeger, Pentecost sends the nuclear-powered Gipsy Danger to help. Gipsy manages to defeat Leatherback and Otachi. Newton and Hannibal go to harvest Otachi\'s secondary brain but discover she is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal before choking on its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant\'s brain, discovering that the Breach only opens in the presence of a Kaiju\'s DNA.\r\nPentecost reveals to Raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation Jaeger, which lacked radiation shielding. His last mission was in Tokyo, where he saved a young Mako. Two new Kaiju are detected guarding the Breach, prompting Gipsy and the repaired Striker, piloted by Pentecost and Chuck, to go ahead with the assault. Approaching the Breach, the Jaegers are attacked by the Kaiju, and a new ""Category Five"" Kaiju, Slattern, leading to Striker being crippled. Pentecost and Chuck decide to sacrifice Striker while Gipsy acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the Breach. After Striker self-destructs, Gipsy slaughters Slattern, riding its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from Gipsy, manually triggers Gipsy\'s self-destruct, and ejects himself before it explodes and seals the Breach. Raleigh and Mako\'s escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean; they embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.\r\nCast\r\nCharlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket: A washed-up former pilot called out of retirement by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated, ""I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And he was the kind of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, \'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy\' ... he has an earthy quality."" Describing the character, Hunnam stated, ""When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I\'ve suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is."" Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro\'s previous film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.\r\nIdris Elba as Marshal Stacker Pentecost: Raleigh\'s commanding officer in Pan Pacific Defense Corps and former Jaeger pilot dying of radiation poisoning due to lax radiation shielding on the first Jaeger models. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated, ""This is a movie where I have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam \'sit down and listen\'?"" In another interview, the director said: ""I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows. I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that\'s the essence of the character ... Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He\'s doing penance for all humanity ... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that."" To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.\r\nRinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori: Raleigh\'s co-pilot who lost her family in a Kaiju attack and was adopted by Pentecost. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro explained, ""I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the other things I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She\'s not going to be a sex kitten, she\'s not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it\'s going to be a real earnestly drawn character."" Noting that the other actors were exhausted and ""destroyed physically"" by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: ""The only one that didn\'t break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained ... I asked Rinko her secret and she said \'I think of gummi bears and flowers.\' I try to do that in my life now."" Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.\r\nCharlie Day as Dr. Newton \'Newt\' Geiszler: A scientist studying the Kaiju. Day stated, ""Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it\'s a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real ... the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they\'ve got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the \'everyman\' and he\'s flawed and he\'s arrogant."" Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a ""big personality"". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia: ""He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, \'This guy is great at shading and comedy.\' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both."" Trek Buccino portrays Newt as a child.\r\nRon Perlman as Hannibal Chau: A black marketeer who makes a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, ""I actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, had the notion, \'Wouldn\'t it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.\' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he\'s someone else and acts like he\'s someone else but he\'s really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character ... I\'m playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona ... which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that\'s the charm of the guy—that he\'s kind of elusive, hard to pin down."" Pacific Rim marks Perlman\'s fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated, ""I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he\'s from Brooklyn and he\'s been selling black market organs, you know the whole story ... That\'s all I need to know. If it\'s any other actor, there\'s a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it\'ll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience."" The bird tattoos on Chau\'s fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster\'s performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.\r\nRobert Kazinsky as Chuck Hansen: An Australian Jaeger pilot considered the finest soldier left in the Resistance. He and his father Herc pilot Striker Eureka, ""the strongest and the fastest"" Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance\'s ""go-to team"". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film\'s concept, ""My immediate reaction was \'Holy crap, that\'s cool.\' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, \'Well, this might be terrible,\' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, \'This is going to be amazing.\'"". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, ""The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun.""\r\nMax Martini as Hercules ""Herc"" Hansen: Chuck\'s father and co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated the fact that he was cast as Chuck\'s father, being only 13 years Kazinsky\'s senior. However, Kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, ""Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had ... The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend."" Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck\'s pet bulldog was del Toro\'s idea and said, ""The dog\'s name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn\'t show each other they would show the dog."" The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman\'s Herc and Hunnam\'s Raleigh ""might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0"".\r\nClifton Collins Jr. as Tendo Choi: A Jaeger technician of Chinese and South American descent. Collins described his character as the ""brains"" behind the Jaegers.\r\nBurn Gorman as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb: A scientist studying the Kaiju alongside Geiszler. According to del Toro, Gottlieb is a ""tweed-wearing, English, phlegmatic introvert that never leaves the lab"". The modest Gottlieb resents Geiszler\'s arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film\'s theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes. Drew Adkins portrays Gottlieb as a child.\r\nDiego Klattenhoff as Yancy Becket: Raleigh\'s older brother and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character, Klattentoff said, ""This is a guy who is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the opportunity to kind of save the world. Or help, at least."" Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child.\r\nAdditional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the Wei Tang triplets (China), and Robert Maillet and Heather Doerksen as Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovsky (Russia). Joe Pingue portrays Captain Merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a battle between Jaeger and Kaiju. Santiago Segura plays an aide to Hannibal Chau. Brad William Henke and Larry Joe Campbell portray members of an Alaskan construction team that Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. Robin Thomas, Julian Barnes, and David Richmond-Peck portray U.N. representatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, respectively. Sebastian Pigott appears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, Jonathan Foxon appears as a frantic civilian. David Fox plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays Raleigh and Yancy\'s mother in a flashback sequence. Producer Thomas Tull makes a cameo appearance. Ellen McLain makes a vocal appearance as the A.I of the Gipsy Danger, a nod to her role as GLaDOS in the Portal game series.\r\nThemes\r\nIn the film, a Jaeger\'s neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilot—a concept called ""drifting"". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other\'s memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept\'s dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:\r\nThe pilots\' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we\'re all together in the same robot ... Either we get along or we die. I didn\'t want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.\r\nDel Toro acknowledged this message\'s simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film\'s ten primary characters all have ""little arcs"" conducive to this idea. Del Toro stated, ""I think that\'s a great message to give kids ... \'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That\'s the guy you have to work with five minutes later.\' That\'s life ... We can only be complete when we work together."" The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil\'s Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.\r\nThe film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of ""opening up"", gaining access to each other\'s thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and ""perfect trust"". Hunnam commented that the film is ""a love story without a love story. It\'s about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself"". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script\'s central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically ""become one"", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters\' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.\r\nDel Toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed ""car commercial aesthetics"" or ""army recruitment video aesthetics"", and gave the characters Western ranks including ""marshal"" and ""ranger"" rather than military ranks such as ""captain"", ""major"" or ""general"". The director stated that he ""avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world."" Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is ""completely remorseless"". The director stated:\r\nI don\'t want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank ... What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you\'re in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, ""I\'m going to destroy Seattle."" In my case, I\'m picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it\'s integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.\r\nWriting for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Wai Chee Dimock connected the film\'s central theme of togetherness to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the ""utopian dream"" driving the characters is\r\nthat puny humans like us could be ""together""—not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.\r\nProduction\r\nDevelopment\r\nIn February 2006, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro would direct Travis Beacham\'s fantasy screenplay Killing on Carnival Row, but the project never materialized. Beacham conceived Pacific Rim the following year. While walking on the beach near Santa Monica Pier, the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. ""They just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things."" He later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking ""what happens when one of those people dies?"" Deciding this would be ""a story about loss, moving on after loss, and dealing with survivor\'s guilt"", Beacham commenced writing the film. On May 28, 2010, it was reported that Legendary Pictures had purchased Beacham\'s detailed 25-page film treatment, now titled Pacific Rim.\r\nOn July 28, 2010, it was reported that del Toro would next direct an adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft\'s At the Mountains of Madness for Universal Studios, with James Cameron producing. When del Toro met with Legendary Pictures to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on a film, he was intrigued by Beacham\'s treatment—still a ""very small pitch"" at this point. Del Toro struck a deal with Legendary: while directing At the Mountains of Madness, he would produce and co-write Pacific Rim; because of the films\' conflicting production schedules, he would direct Pacific Rim only if At the Mountains of Madness were cancelled. Tom Cruise was attached to star in the Lovecraft adaptation.\r\nOn March 7, 2011, it was reported that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, ""When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don\'t want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie."" The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.\r\nDel Toro spent a year working with Beacham on the screenplay, and is credited as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child\'s perspective. The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series Luther and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film Mama. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script Monstropolis caught the filmmaker\'s attention. Drew Pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.\r\nFilming\r\nFilming began on November 14, 2011, and continued in Toronto into April 2012. Del Toro gave an update after the second week on filming finished. The film was referred to as Silent Seas and Still Seas during production.\r\nDel Toro had never shot a film in fewer than 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot Pacific Rim. In order to achieve this, del Toro scheduled a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of the schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing ""looser"" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: ""Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don\'t, but it has to be done that way.""\r\nThe film was shot using Red Epic cameras. At first Guillermo del Toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to 3D, as the effect would not work due to the sheer size of the film\'s robots and monsters, explaining\r\nI didn\'t want to make the movie 3D because when you have things that big ... the thing that happens naturally, you\'re looking at two buildings lets say at 300 feet, if you move there is no parallax. They\'re so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move ... To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their miniaturized, making them human scale.\r\nIt was later announced that the film would be converted to 3D, with the conversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. Del Toro said: ""What can I tell you? I changed my mind. I\'m not running for office. I can do a Romney.""\r\nDel Toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. The unused footage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the director felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen with monsters and giant robots. I cannot pretend I\'m doing a profound reflection on mankind."" Each character\'s arc was edited down to its minimal requirements. The director wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger viewers. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuarón helped with the editing; Iñárritu removed ten minutes of footage, while Cuarón removed ""a few minutes"" and rearranged several scenes. Iñárritu and Cuarón receive a ""special thanks"" in the film\'s end credits, as do James Cameron and David Cronenberg.\r\nDesign\r\nDel Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". The director focused on ""big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals"" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his ""real hope"" is to introduce the Kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children. While the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create something original but ""madly in love"" with its influences, instilled with ""epic beauty"" and ""operatic grandeur"". The ending credits dedicate the film to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda, who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla, respectively. The film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something ""conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything"". The director made a point of starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like Godzilla, Gamera, or The War of the Gargantuas for inspiration, stating: ""I didn\'t want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur."" Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as The Colossus and George Bellows\'s boxing paintings. The film\'s designers include Wayne Barlowe (who is the primary designer of the Kaiju), Oscar Chichoni, monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and Hellboy II and The Hobbit designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco. Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled At the Mountains of Madness adaptation may have been used in Pacific Rim.\r\nApproximately one hundred Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would ""do an American Idol"" and vote for the best. In designing Kaiju, the film\'s artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: ""Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come sort of in families: you\'ve got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju ... So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting."" Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. Del Toro called the film\'s Kaiju ""weapons"", stating that they are ""the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice."" Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films. While del Toro\'s other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.\r\nKnifehead, the first Kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a goblin shark. Leatherback, the bouncer-like Kaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who conceived it as a ""brawler with this sort of beer belly""; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference. The Kaiju Otachi homages the dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a ""Swiss army knife of a Kaiju""; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a Komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary. It is also more intelligent than the other Kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers. Onibaba, the Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and a crustacean. Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and ""half-horn, half-crown"" head, which del Toro considered both demonic and majestic.\r\nGipsy Danger, the American Jaeger, was based on the shape of New York City\'s Art Deco buildings, such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, but infused with John Wayne\'s gunslinger gait and hip movements. Cherno Alpha, the Russian Jaeger, was based on the shape and paint patterns of a T-series Russian tank, combined with a giant containment silo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a cooling tower on its head. Crimson Typhoon, the three-armed Chinese Jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a ""medieval little warrior""; its texture evokes Chinese lacquered wood with golden edges. Striker Eureka, the Australian Jaeger, is likened by del Toro to a Land Rover; the most elegant and masculine Jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling the Australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.\r\nThe film\'s costumes were designed by Shane Mahan and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the Jaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut space suits.\r\nVisual effects\r\nIndustrial Light & Magic was chosen to create the visual effects for Pacific Rim. Del Toro hired Oscar winners John Knoll and Hal T. Hickel, both known for their work on the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Legacy Effects co-owner Shane Mahan, known for creating the armored suits for Iron Man, was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods. Oscar winner Clay Pinney, known for his work on Independence Day and Star Trek, was also brought on board. Hybride Technologies, a division of Ubisoft, and Rodeo FX also contributed to the visual effects.\r\nDel Toro conceived the film as an operatic work:\r\nThat was one of the first words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, ""This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic."" We used a lot of words not usually associated with high-tech blockbusters ... We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges.\r\nThe classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, ""I would say \'Give me a Hokusai wave\' ... we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically."" The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: ""It\'s pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie."" Del Toro considers the film\'s digital water its most exciting visual effect: ""The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I\'d say \'Get out of the wave.\'""\r\nThe film also features extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32TEN Studios, under the supervision of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM\'s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.\r\nMusic\r\nThe film\'s score was composed by Ramin Djawadi. Del Toro selected Djawadi based on his works on Prison Break, Iron Man and Game of Thrones, stating: ""His scores have a grandeur, but they have also an incredible sort of human soul."" The director also stated that some Russian rap would be featured in the film. The soundtrack was released on digital download from Amazon on June 18, 2013, and CD on June 25, 2013. The physical version of the soundtrack was released on July 9, 2013, by WaterTower Music, three days before the theatrical release of the film itself. Guest musicians Tom Morello and Priscilla Ahn also feature as soloists on the score. Two songs appear in the film which are not included on the soundtrack are ""Just Like Your Tenderness"" by Luo Xiaoxuan, and the ending theme ""Drift"", performed by Blake Perlman featuring Rza. The OST received mostly positive reviews. The Action Elite rated the album with a perfect five stars, the Empire gave four, while MSN and Filmtracks also gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. On July 27, 2013, the soundtrack appeared at peak position number 7 on ""US Billboard Top Soundtracks.""\r\nMarketing\r\nOn November 28, 2012, the official film website premiered alongside two viral videos—one depicting the initial Kaiju attack as captured by a handheld camera. Blueprints depicting the designs for the Jaeger machines were also released online. On June 5, 2013, the graphic novel Pacific Rim: Tales from Year Zero was released. Written by Travis Beacham and featuring cover art by Alex Ross, Tales from Year Zero serves as an introductory prologue to the film, and is set twelve years before its events. On June 18, Insight Editions published Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters, an art book written by David S. Cohen. The book chronicles the film\'s production with concept art, photography, the cast and crew\'s accounts of the shoot, and a foreword by del Toro. On July 2, a viral video was released in which Ron Perlman\'s character, Hannibal Chau, advertises his fictional Kaiju organ dealership, Kaiju Remedies.\r\nOn the day of the film\'s release, July 12, 2013, another viral video was released to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro himself) and the YouTube network Polaris (also known as The Game Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the Game Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film\'s Kaiju and Jaegers.\r\nRelease\r\nPacific Rim was initially expected to reach theaters in July 2012. However, Warner Bros. decided to postpone the film\'s release date to May 10, 2013. In March 2012, it was announced that the film would be released on July 12, 2013. The film premiered in Mexico City on July 1, 2013.\r\nHome media\r\nPacific Rim became available for download on the iTunes Store and Vudu on October 1, 2013. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on October 15, 2013, and in the United Kingdom and other countries on November 25, 2013. A collector\'s edition was also available on the same date. To help promote the home media release, Bryan Harley and Roque Rodriguez of Fresno, California, produced a ""sweded"" version of the film\'s Gipsy Danger vs. Otachi battle scene, after del Toro was impressed by the duo\'s ""sweded"" trailer released on YouTube in March 2013. As of March 2014, Pacific Rim has sold 961,845 DVDs along with 1,427,692 Blu-ray Discs in the United States for $10,045,530 and $24,634,992 in revenue, respectively, for a total of $37,079,122. Pacific Rim was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 4, 2016.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nPacific Rim grossed $101.8 million in North America, and has had a favorable international release, grossing $309.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $411.5 million.\r\nThe film grossed $3.6 million from Thursday night showings, 23 percent of which came from IMAX showings. It then faced competition from Grown Ups 2 and ultimately fell behind it on opening day, earning $14.6 million. The film reached the #3 spot during the opening weekend with $37.2 million, behind Despicable Me 2 and Grown Ups 2. This is the highest-ever opening for a film by del Toro, surpassing Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Around 50 percent of tickets were in 3D, which makes it the second-highest 3D share of 2013, behind Gravity. During its second weekend, the film dropped a steep 57% with a gross of $16 million, and during its third weekend, had dropped a further 52% with a gross of $7.7 million. On July 22, 2013, it was reported that the film had reached #1 at the international box office over the weekend. The film had a successful opening in China, grossing $45.2 million, until overtaken by The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. It was the largest opening in China for a Warner Bros. title, and the sixth-largest Chinese debut of all time for any Hollywood film. On August 19, 2013, its gross crossed $100 million in China alone, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing American film ever in China. It grossed a total of $114.3 million in the country, making China the largest market for the film. In Japan, the film landed in the fifth position on opening weekend, with an initial earning of $3 million (behind World War Z\'s gross of $3.4 million).\r\nIn September 2013, Forbes highlighted Pacific Rim as ""the rare English-language film in history to cross $400 million while barely crossing $100 million domestic"".\r\nCritical response\r\nPacific Rim received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 72% approval rating based on 294 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""It may sport more style than substance, but Pacific Rim is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun."" Review aggregation website Metacritic gives the film a rating of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 48 critics, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nThe Daily Telegraph\'s Robbie Collin awarded the film five stars out of five, likening the experience of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project in such a way that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had ever tried to fulfill. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had ""no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry"", praising the ""clean and coherent"" action sequences and the ""terrific chemistry"" between Hunnam and Kikuchi. Drew McWeeny of HitFix highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design. He also praised the cinematography for ""perfectly capturing"" the film, and described the score as ""ridiculously cool"". Rolling Stone\'s Peter Travers called the film ""the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion"", saying that del Toro ""drives the action with a heartbeat"". Keith Uhlich of Time Out called the film ""pure, pleasurable comic-book absurdity"", and noted that del Toro had lent the proceedings a ""plausible humanity"" lacking in most of summer 2013\'s destruction-heavy blockbusters. He said the Kaijus\' civilian victims make a ""palpably personal impression"", deeming one scene with Mako Mori ""as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like Neon Genesis Evangelion, that the director emulates with expert aplomb."" The Village Voice\'s Stephanie Zacharek called it ""summer entertainment with a pulse"", praising its ""dumbly brilliant"" action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro\'s time would be better spent on more visionary films. Angela Watercutter of Wired called it the ""most awesome movie of the summer"", a ""fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride"", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization ""simply does not matter"" in the summer blockbuster context. Richard Roeper gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju ""can take down any of the Transformers."" Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it ""three-quarters of a really good movie that doesn\'t know when to quit.""\r\nThe Guardian\'s Andrew Pulver was less enthusiastic, calling the film a mix of ""wafer-thin psychodrama"" and ""plot-generator dialogue"". Time\'s Richard Corliss said the action was let down by ""inert"" drama, describing the film as ""45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome."" Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro\'s previous films. The New Yorker\'s Anthony Lane\'s verdict read as ""It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant."" The San Francisco Chronicle\'s Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating ""If this is the best we can do in terms of movies—if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with ... Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan\'s Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer ... Why go to the movies to look at somebody else\'s computer after looking at your own all week? ... The actors can\'t make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain."" Slant Magazine\'s Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: ""a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle"". TheWrap\'s Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a ""charisma black hole"". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences ""five IQ points out of five"" as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.\r\nOther response\r\nDirector Rian Johnson praised the film, as did Japanese game director Hideo Kojima, who called it the ""ultimate otaku film"" and stated he ""never imagined would be fortunate enough to see a film like this in life"". Go Nagai, who pioneered the idea of mecha piloted from an interior cockpit, praised the film\'s fun and intense action, while game developer Fumito Ueda said its battle scenes surpassed memories of the tokusatsu films he saw as an impressionable child. Science fiction author William Gibson called the film ""A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, in the service of what is at heart a children\'s story ... A baroque that doesn\'t curdle, that never fetishizes itself.""\r\nAccolades\r\nLegacy\r\nNamed after the female character from the film, Mako Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi), the Mako Mori test is a set of requirements designed to measure the level of gender equality in a film or TV show. Derived from the Bechdel test, it was born from the following observation: even though the film Pacific Rim gives a rather good representation of women, it fails the Bechdel test. The criterion of the Mako Mori test is as follows: there is at least one female character; with her own narrative arc; independent to that of a male character.\r\nSequel\r\nA sequel titled Pacific Rim: Uprising, directed by Steven S. DeKnight and produced by Del Toro, with Kikuchi, Day, and Gorman reprising their roles, and Universal Pictures taking the film distribution, was released on March 23, 2018.\r\nOther media\r\nVideo game\r\nA single-player fighting video game based on the film was announced by the Australian Classification Board for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Published and developed by Yuke\'s, Pacific Rim: The Video Game was released along with the film on July 12, 2013. The game received generally negative reviews. Reliance Games developed a Pacific Rim tie-in game for smartphone platforms, such as iOS and Android devices; this version also received negative reviews.\r\nAnime series\r\nOn November 8, 2018, Netflix announced an original anime series that expands upon the story and universe of the two live-action movies. On October 27, 2020, the anime was officially titled Pacific Rim: The Black, and would follow two siblings that are forced to pilot an abandoned Jaeger ""across a hostile landscape in a desperate attempt to find their missing parents"". The anime would be animated by Polygon Pictures, with Marvel Comics writer Craig Kyle and Greg Johnson serving as the showrunners. The first season released on March 4, 2021 and the second and final season was released on April 19, 2022.\r\nAmusement park ride\r\nA 3D amusement park ride, titled Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Strike, opened in 2019 at Trans Studio Cibubur in collaboration with Legendary Entertainment. The ride guides audiences through a battle between the Jaegers and the Kaiju. The ride features walkthrough sections with actors in the middle of the ride. Over the course of its 20-minute run time, audiences are introduced to 3 new Kaiju\'s and Indonesia\'s own Jaeger: Storm Garuda.', 'html': '<p>Pacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster film directed by Guillermo del Toro, starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman, and the first film in the Pacific Rim franchise. The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war\'s later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.</p><p>Principal photography began on November 14, 2011, in Toronto and lasted through to April 2012. The film was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. It was released on July 12, 2013, in 3D and IMAX 3D, receiving generally positive reviews; the visual effects, action sequences, and nostalgic style were highly praised. While it underperformed at the box office in the United States, it was highly successful in other markets, thus becoming film a box office success. It earned a worldwide total of more than $411 million—earning $114 million in China alone, its largest market—becoming Del Toro\'s most commercially successful film. The film is regarded as an homage to kaiju, mecha, and anime media.</p><p>A sequel titled Pacific Rim: Uprising was released on March 23, 2018, with Universal Pictures distributing.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>In 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional portal called ""The Breach"" at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and attacking coastal cities. In response, humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers. Each is co-piloted by two or more people who share a mental link by a process called ""Drifting"" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.</p><p>In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the American Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed ""Knifehead"". The Kaiju unexpectedly pierces the Jaeger\'s armor, ripping out half of its head and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the damaged Jaeger solo, kills Knifehead and walks Gipsy to shore before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of his brother and the stress of piloting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.</p><p>Five years later, world leaders decide to cease funding for the Jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, since Kaiju are appearing more frequently and Jaegers are being destroyed as quickly as they are built. The walls are quickly proven to be ineffective. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under the command of Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to try to destroy the Breach using a tactical nuclear weapon, even though previous attempts to do so have failed.</p><p>Raleigh, now working in wall construction, is recruited by Pentecost for the mission. Travelling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the director of the Jaeger\'s restoration program and Pentecost\'s adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation – the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, the Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka, piloted by father-and-son team, Herc and Chuck Hansen. To find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts and decides that Mako is ""drift-compatible"". During their first test, Raleigh falls out of alignment after reliving Yancy\'s death, causing Mako to become lost in the memory of a Kaiju attack on Tokyo, nearly firing Gipsy\'s energy cannon. As a result, Pentecost grounds Mako.</p><p>Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed. Newton suggests attempting to drift with a Kaiju\'s brain to learn more about them but is dismissed by his colleagues. He tries it regardless, discovering that Kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. Pentecost instructs Newton to find black market dealer Hannibal Chau to obtain another Kaiju brain to drift with it. Newton realizes the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and the two newest Kaiju to emerge, Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him in Hong Kong.</p><p>All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger are dispatched to intervene. The Kaijus destroy Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha, while Leatherback disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. As the only non-digital Jaeger, Pentecost sends the nuclear-powered Gipsy Danger to help. Gipsy manages to defeat Leatherback and Otachi. Newton and Hannibal go to harvest Otachi\'s secondary brain but discover she is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal before choking on its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant\'s brain, discovering that the Breach only opens in the presence of a Kaiju\'s DNA.</p><p>Pentecost reveals to Raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation Jaeger, which lacked radiation shielding. His last mission was in Tokyo, where he saved a young Mako. Two new Kaiju are detected guarding the Breach, prompting Gipsy and the repaired Striker, piloted by Pentecost and Chuck, to go ahead with the assault. Approaching the Breach, the Jaegers are attacked by the Kaiju, and a new ""Category Five"" Kaiju, Slattern, leading to Striker being crippled. Pentecost and Chuck decide to sacrifice Striker while Gipsy acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the Breach. After Striker self-destructs, Gipsy slaughters Slattern, riding its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from Gipsy, manually triggers Gipsy\'s self-destruct, and ejects himself before it explodes and seals the Breach. Raleigh and Mako\'s escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean; they embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket: A washed-up former pilot called out of retirement by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated, ""I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And he was the kind of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, \'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy\' ... he has an earthy quality."" Describing the character, Hunnam stated, ""When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I\'ve suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is."" Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro\'s previous film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.</li><li>Idris Elba as Marshal Stacker Pentecost: Raleigh\'s commanding officer in Pan Pacific Defense Corps and former Jaeger pilot dying of radiation poisoning due to lax radiation shielding on the first Jaeger models. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated, ""This is a movie where I have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam \'sit down and listen\'?"" In another interview, the director said: ""I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows. I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that\'s the essence of the character ... Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He\'s doing penance for all humanity ... Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that."" To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.</li><li>Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori: Raleigh\'s co-pilot who lost her family in a Kaiju attack and was adopted by Pentecost. Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro explained, ""I was very careful how I built the movie. One of the other things I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She\'s not going to be a sex kitten, she\'s not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it\'s going to be a real earnestly drawn character."" Noting that the other actors were exhausted and ""destroyed physically"" by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: ""The only one that didn\'t break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained ... I asked Rinko her secret and she said \'I think of gummi bears and flowers.\' I try to do that in my life now."" Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.</li><li>Charlie Day as Dr. Newton \'Newt\' Geiszler: A scientist studying the Kaiju. Day stated, ""Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it\'s a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real ... the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they\'ve got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the \'everyman\' and he\'s flawed and he\'s arrogant."" Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a ""big personality"". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia: ""He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, \'This guy is great at shading and comedy.\' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both."" Trek Buccino portrays Newt as a child.</li><li>Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau: A black marketeer who makes a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, ""I actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, had the notion, \'Wouldn\'t it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.\' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he\'s someone else and acts like he\'s someone else but he\'s really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character ... I\'m playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona ... which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that\'s the charm of the guy—that he\'s kind of elusive, hard to pin down."" Pacific Rim marks Perlman\'s fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated, ""I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he\'s from Brooklyn and he\'s been selling black market organs, you know the whole story ... That\'s all I need to know. If it\'s any other actor, there\'s a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it\'ll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience."" The bird tattoos on Chau\'s fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster\'s performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.</li><li>Robert Kazinsky as Chuck Hansen: An Australian Jaeger pilot considered the finest soldier left in the Resistance. He and his father Herc pilot Striker Eureka, ""the strongest and the fastest"" Jaeger with eleven Kaiju kills, and make up the Resistance\'s ""go-to team"". Kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film\'s concept, ""My immediate reaction was \'Holy crap, that\'s cool.\' In the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, \'Well, this might be terrible,\' but with del Toro doing it, you kind of go, \'This is going to be amazing.\'"". Reflecting on his experience in the film, Kazinsky said in an interview, ""The most fun I have ever had in my entire life was Pacific Rim, playing Chuck was incredibly fun.""</li><li>Max Martini as Hercules ""Herc"" Hansen: Chuck\'s father and co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated the fact that he was cast as Chuck\'s father, being only 13 years Kazinsky\'s senior. However, Kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, ""Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had ... The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend."" Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck\'s pet bulldog was del Toro\'s idea and said, ""The dog\'s name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn\'t show each other they would show the dog."" The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman\'s Herc and Hunnam\'s Raleigh ""might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0"".</li><li>Clifton Collins Jr. as Tendo Choi: A Jaeger technician of Chinese and South American descent. Collins described his character as the ""brains"" behind the Jaegers.</li><li>Burn Gorman as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb: A scientist studying the Kaiju alongside Geiszler. According to del Toro, Gottlieb is a ""tweed-wearing, English, phlegmatic introvert that never leaves the lab"". The modest Gottlieb resents Geiszler\'s arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film\'s theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes. Drew Adkins portrays Gottlieb as a child.</li><li>Diego Klattenhoff as Yancy Becket: Raleigh\'s older brother and co-pilot. Klattenhoff joined the project to work with del Toro. Describing his character, Klattentoff said, ""This is a guy who is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the opportunity to kind of save the world. Or help, at least."" Tyler Stevenson plays Yancy as a child.</li></ul><p>Additional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the Wei Tang triplets (China), and Robert Maillet and Heather Doerksen as Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovsky (Russia). Joe Pingue portrays Captain Merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a battle between Jaeger and Kaiju. Santiago Segura plays an aide to Hannibal Chau. Brad William Henke and Larry Joe Campbell portray members of an Alaskan construction team that Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. Robin Thomas, Julian Barnes, and David Richmond-Peck portray U.N. representatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada, respectively. Sebastian Pigott appears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, Jonathan Foxon appears as a frantic civilian. David Fox plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays Raleigh and Yancy\'s mother in a flashback sequence. Producer Thomas Tull makes a cameo appearance. Ellen McLain makes a vocal appearance as the A.I of the Gipsy Danger, a nod to her role as GLaDOS in the Portal game series.</p><br/><h3>Themes</h3><p>In the film, a Jaeger\'s neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilot—a concept called ""drifting"". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other\'s memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept\'s dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:</p><blockquote>The pilots\' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we\'re all together in the same robot ... Either we get along or we die. I didn\'t want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.</blockquote><p>Del Toro acknowledged this message\'s simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film\'s ten primary characters all have ""little arcs"" conducive to this idea. Del Toro stated, ""I think that\'s a great message to give kids ... \'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That\'s the guy you have to work with five minutes later.\' That\'s life ... We can only be complete when we work together."" The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil\'s Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.</p><p>The film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of ""opening up"", gaining access to each other\'s thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and ""perfect trust"". Hunnam commented that the film is ""a love story without a love story. It\'s about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself"". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script\'s central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically ""become one"", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters\' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.</p><p>Del Toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed ""car commercial aesthetics"" or ""army recruitment video aesthetics"", and gave the characters Western ranks including ""marshal"" and ""ranger"" rather than military ranks such as ""captain"", ""major"" or ""general"". The director stated that he ""avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world."" Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is ""completely remorseless"". The director stated:</p><blockquote>I don\'t want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank ... What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you\'re in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, ""I\'m going to destroy Seattle."" In my case, I\'m picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it\'s integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.</blockquote><p>Writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Wai Chee Dimock connected the film\'s central theme of togetherness to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the ""utopian dream"" driving the characters is</p><blockquote>that puny humans like us could be ""together""—not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.</blockquote><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Development</h4><p>In February 2006, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro would direct Travis Beacham\'s fantasy screenplay Killing on Carnival Row, but the project never materialized. Beacham conceived Pacific Rim the following year. While walking on the beach near Santa Monica Pier, the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. ""They just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things."" He later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking ""what happens when one of those people dies?"" Deciding this would be ""a story about loss, moving on after loss, and dealing with survivor\'s guilt"", Beacham commenced writing the film. On May 28, 2010, it was reported that Legendary Pictures had purchased Beacham\'s detailed 25-page film treatment, now titled Pacific Rim.</p><p>On July 28, 2010, it was reported that del Toro would next direct an adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft\'s At the Mountains of Madness for Universal Studios, with James Cameron producing. When del Toro met with Legendary Pictures to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on a film, he was intrigued by Beacham\'s treatment—still a ""very small pitch"" at this point. Del Toro struck a deal with Legendary: while directing At the Mountains of Madness, he would produce and co-write Pacific Rim; because of the films\' conflicting production schedules, he would direct Pacific Rim only if At the Mountains of Madness were cancelled. Tom Cruise was attached to star in the Lovecraft adaptation.</p><p>On March 7, 2011, it was reported that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, ""When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don\'t want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie."" The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.</p><p>Del Toro spent a year working with Beacham on the screenplay, and is credited as co-writer. He introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre, such as a Kaiju birth and a Kaiju attack seen from a child\'s perspective. The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series Luther and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film Mama. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script Monstropolis caught the filmmaker\'s attention. Drew Pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>Filming began on November 14, 2011, and continued in Toronto into April 2012. Del Toro gave an update after the second week on filming finished. The film was referred to as Silent Seas and Still Seas during production.</p><p>Del Toro had never shot a film in fewer than 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot Pacific Rim. In order to achieve this, del Toro scheduled a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of the schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing ""looser"" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: ""Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. I do not delegate anything. Some people like it, some people don\'t, but it has to be done that way.""</p><p>The film was shot using Red Epic cameras. At first Guillermo del Toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to 3D, as the effect would not work due to the sheer size of the film\'s robots and monsters, explaining</p><blockquote>I didn\'t want to make the movie 3D because when you have things that big ... the thing that happens naturally, you\'re looking at two buildings lets say at 300 feet, if you move there is no parallax. They\'re so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move ... To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their miniaturized, making them human scale.</blockquote><p>It was later announced that the film would be converted to 3D, with the conversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. Del Toro said: ""What can I tell you? I changed my mind. I\'m not running for office. I can do a Romney.""</p><p>Del Toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. The unused footage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the director felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen with monsters and giant robots. I cannot pretend I\'m doing a profound reflection on mankind."" Each character\'s arc was edited down to its minimal requirements. The director wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger viewers. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuarón helped with the editing; Iñárritu removed ten minutes of footage, while Cuarón removed ""a few minutes"" and rearranged several scenes. Iñárritu and Cuarón receive a ""special thanks"" in the film\'s end credits, as do James Cameron and David Cronenberg.</p><h4>Design</h4><p>Del Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". The director focused on ""big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals"" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his ""real hope"" is to introduce the Kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children. While the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. Del Toro intended to create something original but ""madly in love"" with its influences, instilled with ""epic beauty"" and ""operatic grandeur"". The ending credits dedicate the film to Ray Harryhausen and Ishirō Honda, who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla, respectively. The film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something ""conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything"". The director made a point of starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers not to turn to films like Godzilla, Gamera, or The War of the Gargantuas for inspiration, stating: ""I didn\'t want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur."" Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as The Colossus and George Bellows\'s boxing paintings. The film\'s designers include Wayne Barlowe (who is the primary designer of the Kaiju), Oscar Chichoni, monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and Hellboy II and The Hobbit designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco. Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled At the Mountains of Madness adaptation may have been used in Pacific Rim.</p><p>Approximately one hundred Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would ""do an American Idol"" and vote for the best. In designing Kaiju, the film\'s artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: ""Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come sort of in families: you\'ve got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju ... So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting."" Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. Del Toro called the film\'s Kaiju ""weapons"", stating that they are ""the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice."" Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films. While del Toro\'s other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.</p><p>Knifehead, the first Kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a goblin shark. Leatherback, the bouncer-like Kaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who conceived it as a ""brawler with this sort of beer belly""; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference. The Kaiju Otachi homages the dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a ""Swiss army knife of a Kaiju""; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a Komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary. It is also more intelligent than the other Kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers. Onibaba, the Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and a crustacean. Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and ""half-horn, half-crown"" head, which del Toro considered both demonic and majestic.</p><p>Gipsy Danger, the American Jaeger, was based on the shape of New York City\'s Art Deco buildings, such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, but infused with John Wayne\'s gunslinger gait and hip movements. Cherno Alpha, the Russian Jaeger, was based on the shape and paint patterns of a T-series Russian tank, combined with a giant containment silo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a cooling tower on its head. Crimson Typhoon, the three-armed Chinese Jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a ""medieval little warrior""; its texture evokes Chinese lacquered wood with golden edges. Striker Eureka, the Australian Jaeger, is likened by del Toro to a Land Rover; the most elegant and masculine Jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling the Australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.</p><p>The film\'s costumes were designed by Shane Mahan and Kate Hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the Jaeger pilots. The Russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut space suits.</p><h4>Visual effects</h4><p>Industrial Light & Magic was chosen to create the visual effects for Pacific Rim. Del Toro hired Oscar winners John Knoll and Hal T. Hickel, both known for their work on the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Legacy Effects co-owner Shane Mahan, known for creating the armored suits for Iron Man, was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods. Oscar winner Clay Pinney, known for his work on Independence Day and Star Trek, was also brought on board. Hybride Technologies, a division of Ubisoft, and Rodeo FX also contributed to the visual effects.</p><p>Del Toro conceived the film as an operatic work:</p><blockquote>That was one of the first words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, ""This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic."" We used a lot of words not usually associated with high-tech blockbusters ... We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges.</blockquote><p>The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, ""I would say \'Give me a Hokusai wave\' ... we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically."" The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: ""It\'s pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie."" Del Toro considers the film\'s digital water its most exciting visual effect: ""The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I\'d say \'Get out of the wave.\'""</p><p>The film also features extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32TEN Studios, under the supervision of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM\'s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.</p><br/><h3>Music</h3><p>The film\'s score was composed by Ramin Djawadi. Del Toro selected Djawadi based on his works on Prison Break, Iron Man and Game of Thrones, stating: ""His scores have a grandeur, but they have also an incredible sort of human soul."" The director also stated that some Russian rap would be featured in the film. The soundtrack was released on digital download from Amazon on June 18, 2013, and CD on June 25, 2013. The physical version of the soundtrack was released on July 9, 2013, by WaterTower Music, three days before the theatrical release of the film itself. Guest musicians Tom Morello and Priscilla Ahn also feature as soloists on the score. Two songs appear in the film which are not included on the soundtrack are ""Just Like Your Tenderness"" by Luo Xiaoxuan, and the ending theme ""Drift"", performed by Blake Perlman featuring Rza. The OST received mostly positive reviews. The Action Elite rated the album with a perfect five stars, the Empire gave four, while MSN and Filmtracks also gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. On July 27, 2013, the soundtrack appeared at peak position number 7 on ""US Billboard Top Soundtracks.""</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><p>On November 28, 2012, the official film website premiered alongside two viral videos—one depicting the initial Kaiju attack as captured by a handheld camera. Blueprints depicting the designs for the Jaeger machines were also released online. On June 5, 2013, the graphic novel Pacific Rim: Tales from Year Zero was released. Written by Travis Beacham and featuring cover art by Alex Ross, Tales from Year Zero serves as an introductory prologue to the film, and is set twelve years before its events. On June 18, Insight Editions published Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters, an art book written by David S. Cohen. The book chronicles the film\'s production with concept art, photography, the cast and crew\'s accounts of the shoot, and a foreword by del Toro. On July 2, a viral video was released in which Ron Perlman\'s character, Hannibal Chau, advertises his fictional Kaiju organ dealership, Kaiju Remedies.</p><p>On the day of the film\'s release, July 12, 2013, another viral video was released to promote the film. It involved the collaboration of the film studio (including del Toro himself) and the YouTube network Polaris (also known as The Game Station). It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the Game Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film\'s Kaiju and Jaegers.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><p>Pacific Rim was initially expected to reach theaters in July 2012. However, Warner Bros. decided to postpone the film\'s release date to May 10, 2013. In March 2012, it was announced that the film would be released on July 12, 2013. The film premiered in Mexico City on July 1, 2013.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Pacific Rim became available for download on the iTunes Store and Vudu on October 1, 2013. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on October 15, 2013, and in the United Kingdom and other countries on November 25, 2013. A collector\'s edition was also available on the same date. To help promote the home media release, Bryan Harley and Roque Rodriguez of Fresno, California, produced a ""sweded"" version of the film\'s Gipsy Danger vs. Otachi battle scene, after del Toro was impressed by the duo\'s ""sweded"" trailer released on YouTube in March 2013. As of March 2014, Pacific Rim has sold 961,845 DVDs along with 1,427,692 Blu-ray Discs in the United States for $10,045,530 and $24,634,992 in revenue, respectively, for a total of $37,079,122. Pacific Rim was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 4, 2016.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>Pacific Rim grossed $101.8 million in North America, and has had a favorable international release, grossing $309.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $411.5 million.</p><p>The film grossed $3.6 million from Thursday night showings, 23 percent of which came from IMAX showings. It then faced competition from Grown Ups 2 and ultimately fell behind it on opening day, earning $14.6 million. The film reached the #3 spot during the opening weekend with $37.2 million, behind Despicable Me 2 and Grown Ups 2. This is the highest-ever opening for a film by del Toro, surpassing Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Around 50 percent of tickets were in 3D, which makes it the second-highest 3D share of 2013, behind Gravity. During its second weekend, the film dropped a steep 57% with a gross of $16 million, and during its third weekend, had dropped a further 52% with a gross of $7.7 million. On July 22, 2013, it was reported that the film had reached #1 at the international box office over the weekend. The film had a successful opening in China, grossing $45.2 million, until overtaken by The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. It was the largest opening in China for a Warner Bros. title, and the sixth-largest Chinese debut of all time for any Hollywood film. On August 19, 2013, its gross crossed $100 million in China alone, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing American film ever in China. It grossed a total of $114.3 million in the country, making China the largest market for the film. In Japan, the film landed in the fifth position on opening weekend, with an initial earning of $3 million (behind World War Z\'s gross of $3.4 million).</p><p>In September 2013, Forbes highlighted Pacific Rim as ""the rare English-language film in history to cross $400 million while barely crossing $100 million domestic"".</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Pacific Rim received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 72% approval rating based on 294 reviews, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The website\'s critical consensus reads, ""It may sport more style than substance, but Pacific Rim is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun."" Review aggregation website Metacritic gives the film a rating of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 48 critics, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.</p><p>The Daily Telegraph\'s Robbie Collin awarded the film five stars out of five, likening the experience of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project in such a way that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had ever tried to fulfill. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had ""no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry"", praising the ""clean and coherent"" action sequences and the ""terrific chemistry"" between Hunnam and Kikuchi. Drew McWeeny of HitFix highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design. He also praised the cinematography for ""perfectly capturing"" the film, and described the score as ""ridiculously cool"". Rolling Stone\'s Peter Travers called the film ""the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion"", saying that del Toro ""drives the action with a heartbeat"". Keith Uhlich of Time Out called the film ""pure, pleasurable comic-book absurdity"", and noted that del Toro had lent the proceedings a ""plausible humanity"" lacking in most of summer 2013\'s destruction-heavy blockbusters. He said the Kaijus\' civilian victims make a ""palpably personal impression"", deeming one scene with Mako Mori ""as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like Neon Genesis Evangelion, that the director emulates with expert aplomb."" The Village Voice\'s Stephanie Zacharek called it ""summer entertainment with a pulse"", praising its ""dumbly brilliant"" action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro\'s time would be better spent on more visionary films. Angela Watercutter of Wired called it the ""most awesome movie of the summer"", a ""fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride"", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization ""simply does not matter"" in the summer blockbuster context. Richard Roeper gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju ""can take down any of the Transformers."" Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it ""three-quarters of a really good movie that doesn\'t know when to quit.""</p><p>The Guardian\'s Andrew Pulver was less enthusiastic, calling the film a mix of ""wafer-thin psychodrama"" and ""plot-generator dialogue"". Time\'s Richard Corliss said the action was let down by ""inert"" drama, describing the film as ""45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome."" Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro\'s previous films. The New Yorker\'s Anthony Lane\'s verdict read as ""It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant."" The San Francisco Chronicle\'s Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating ""If this is the best we can do in terms of movies—if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with ... Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan\'s Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer ... Why go to the movies to look at somebody else\'s computer after looking at your own all week? ... The actors can\'t make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain."" Slant Magazine\'s Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: ""a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle"". TheWrap\'s Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a ""charisma black hole"". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences ""five IQ points out of five"" as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.</p><h4>Other response</h4><p>Director Rian Johnson praised the film, as did Japanese game director Hideo Kojima, who called it the ""ultimate otaku film"" and stated he ""never imagined would be fortunate enough to see a film like this in life"". Go Nagai, who pioneered the idea of mecha piloted from an interior cockpit, praised the film\'s fun and intense action, while game developer Fumito Ueda said its battle scenes surpassed memories of the tokusatsu films he saw as an impressionable child. Science fiction author William Gibson called the film ""A ravishing display of intelligent, often wonderfully witty visual design, every frame alive with coherent language, in the service of what is at heart a children\'s story ... A baroque that doesn\'t curdle, that never fetishizes itself.""</p><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=""table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100""><tbody><tr><th>Award</th><th>Category</th><th>Recipients</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td><span>ABFF Hollywood Awards</span></td><td>Artist of the Year</td><td><span>Idris Elba</span> (also for <i><span>Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom</span></i> and <i><span>Thor: The Dark World</span></i>)</td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=""2""><span class=""mw-redirect"">Annie Award</span></td><td>Outstanding Achievement, Animated Effects in a Live Action Production</td><td></td><td style=""background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""yes table-yes2"">Won</td></tr><tr><td>Outstanding Achievement, Character Animation in a Live Action Production</td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>British Academy Film Awards</span></td><td><span>Best Special Visual Effects</span></td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span class=""mw-redirect"">Critics\' Choice Movie Award</span></td><td><span class=""mw-redirect"">Best Visual Effects</span></td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td>Denver Film Critics Society</td><td>Best Science Fiction/Horror Film</td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>Empire Awards</span></td><td>Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy</td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td>Hollywood Film Awards</td><td>Best Visual Effects</td><td>John Knoll</td><td style=""background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""yes table-yes2"">Won</td></tr><tr><td>Las Vegas Film Critics Society</td><td>Best Horror/Sci-Fi Film</td><td></td><td style=""background: #9EFF9E; color: #000; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""yes table-yes2"">Won</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=""5""><span class=""mw-redirect"">Saturn Award</span></td><td><span>Best Science Fiction Film</span></td><td></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Director</span></td><td><span>Guillermo del Toro</span></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td>Best Production Design</td><td>Andrew Neskoromny and <span>Carol Spier</span></td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Editing</span></td><td>Peter Amundson and John Gilroy</td><td style=""background: #FFE3E3; color: black; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"" class=""no table-no2"">Nominated</td></tr><tr><td><span>Best Special Effects</span></td><td>John Knoll, James E.

Derived from the Bechdel test, it was born from the following observation: even though the film Pacific Rim gives a rather good representation of women, it fails the Bechdel test. The criterion of the Mako Mori test is as follows: there is at least one female character; with her own narrative arc; independent to that of a male character.</p><br/><h3>Sequel</h3><p>A sequel titled Pacific Rim: Uprising, directed by Steven S. DeKnight and produced by Del Toro, with Kikuchi, Day, and Gorman reprising their roles, and Universal Pictures taking the film distribution, was released on March 23, 2018.</p><br/><h3>Other media</h3><h4>Video game</h4><p>A single-player fighting video game based on the film was announced by the Australian Classification Board for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Published and developed by Yuke\'s, Pacific Rim: The Video Game was released along with the film on July 12, 2013. The game received generally negative reviews. Reliance Games developed a Pacific Rim tie-in game for smartphone platforms, such as iOS and Android devices; this version also received negative reviews.</p><h4>Anime series</h4><p>On November 8, 2018, Netflix announced an original anime series that expands upon the story and universe of the two live-action movies. On October 27, 2020, the anime was officially titled Pacific Rim: The Black, and would follow two siblings that are forced to pilot an abandoned Jaeger ""across a hostile landscape in a desperate attempt to find their missing parents"". The anime would be animated by Polygon Pictures, with Marvel Comics writer Craig Kyle and Greg Johnson serving as the showrunners. The first season released on March 4, 2021 and the second and final season was released on April 19, 2022.</p><h4>Amusement park ride</h4><p>A 3D amusement park ride, titled Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Strike, opened in 2019 at Trans Studio Cibubur in collaboration with Legendary Entertainment. The ride guides audiences through a battle between the Jaegers and the Kaiju. The ride features walkthrough sections with actors in the middle of the ride. Over the course of its 20-minute run time, audiences are introduced to 3 new Kaiju\'s and Indonesia\'s own Jaeger: Storm Garuda.</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt1663662', 'title': 'Pacific Rim', 'fullTitle': 'Pacific Rim (2013)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '2013', 'posters': [], 'backdrops': [], 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt1663662', 'title': 'Pacific Rim', 'fullTitle': 'Pacific Rim (2013)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '2013', 'videoId': 'vi1369752345', 'videoTitle': '4K Trailer', 'videoDescription': 'As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU1ODNkNjItNTg3Ny00MWRiLWE0ZDktOWI0NTVmNDYzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg', 'uploadDate': '09/22/2021 03:35:28', 'link': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1369752345', 'linkEmbed': 'https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1369752345/imdb/embed', 'errorMessage': ''}",,"kaiju,human piloted robot,ocean,apocalypse,human versus monster","[{'id': 'tt2557478', 'title': 'Pacific Rim: Uprising', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3Nzg0MTM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE2MTgwNTM@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '5.6'}, {'id': 'tt0433035', 'title': 'Real Steel', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMzEzNjg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg4NDk0Ng@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '7.0'}, {'id': 'tt0418279', 'title': 'Transformers', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1NTU2OWEtM2UzYi00ZWRmLWEwMTktZWNjYWQ1NWM1OThjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '7.0'}, {'id': 'tt0831387', 'title': 'Godzilla', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDFmYTM4NzAtNWM0ZC00MGJlLWEyYzQtYzA3ZTFiNzc1YjllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA4NjE0NjEy._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.4'}, {'id': 'tt3731562', 'title': 'Kong: Skull Island', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxNjZiNTAtZmMwMi00MmYxLTkxZGEtZWE1MzU0OWFjOTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzk1MzI3MTI@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.6'}, {'id': 'tt1399103', 'title': 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwOTY0MTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNjA2NQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.2'}, {'id': 'tt1318514', 'title': 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE3ZmNlZTctMDdmNy00MjMzLWFmZmYtN2M5N2YyYTQ1ZDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '7.6'}, {'id': 'tt1104001', 'title': 'TRON: Legacy', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTk4MTk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE2MDIwNA@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.8'}, {'id': 'tt4701182', 'title': 'Bumblebee', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUwNjU5NDMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzgxNjM2NzM@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.7'}, {'id': 'tt1823672', 'title': 'Chappie', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTI4NTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ4MTI0NDE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.8'}, {'id': 'tt0167190', 'title': 'Hellboy', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc1ZWY0ZTEtZTVmNi00MTg0LTg4NmQtZTI4OWNiMmQ0MWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_Ratio0.7343_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '6.8'}, {'id': 'tt2103281', 'title': 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', 'image': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwODk3NDc1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc1NjQwMjE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg', 'imDbRating': '7.6'}]","$190,000,000 (estimated)","$37,285,325","$101,802,906","$411,002,906"

The Last Jedi (2017) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019) followed The Force Awakens, rounding out the Star Wars sequel trilogy.\r\nPlot\r\nThirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who has gone missing.\r\nOn the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke\'s location from Lor San Tekka. Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village and capture Poe, ultimately killing San Tekka and slaughtering the villagers. Poe\'s droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned by the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name ""Finn"". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and finds only Poe\'s jacket in the wreck, leading to the assumption of his death. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon and escape the planet.\r\nThe Falcon is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the Falcon. At the First Order\'s Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux\'s request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo\'s ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\r\nAboard the Falcon, Han determines that BB-8\'s map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds the lightsaber once belonging to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz\'s offering, and flees into the woods, confused and terrified. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\r\nStarkiller Base demostrates its power by simultaneously destroying the New Republic capital of Hosnian Prime and four of its neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a Stormtrooper guard.\r\nAt the Resistance base on D\'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been inactive since Luke\'s disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han instead. Devastated, Chewbacca shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base\'s thermal oscillator.\r\nThe injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods. Kylo incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is overcome due to his lack of experience. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel; they are then separated by a fissure as the planet\'s surface begins to splinter. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the Falcon. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.\r\nRey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the Falcon. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island. Without a word, she presents him with his father\'s lightsaber.\r\nCast\r\nHarrison Ford as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the Millennium Falcon\r\nMark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding\r\nCarrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: A leader of the Resistance\r\nAdam Driver as Kylo Ren: A leader of the Knights of Ren and the commander of the First Order, who is the son of Han and Leia\r\nDaisy Ridley as Rey: A Force-sensitive scavengerCailey Fleming as young Rey\r\nCailey Fleming as young Rey\r\nJohn Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper\r\nOscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A high-ranking X-wing fighter pilot of the Resistance\r\nLupita Nyong\'o as Maz Kanata: A centuries-old and perceptive alien who owns a castle on the peaceful forest planet Takodana\r\nAndy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: A enigmatic, artificially genetic leader of the First Order\r\nDomhnall Gleeson as General Hux: The commander of the First Order\'s Starkiller Base\r\nAnthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid\r\nPeter Mayhew as Chewbacca: Han\'s loyal Wookiee friend and co-pilotJoonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems\r\nJoonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems\r\nMax von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A galactic explorer searching for Luke Skywalker\r\nTim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from Return of the Jedi, with Erik Bauersfeld and Kipsang Rotich returning their respective voices.

In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company. Speaking alongside Lucasfilm\'s new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: ""I always said I wasn\'t going to do any more and that\'s true, because I\'m not going to do any more, but that doesn\'t mean I\'m unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.""\r\nAs creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe. Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII–IX, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan F. Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer. Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film. Lucas\' son Jett told The Guardian that his father was ""very torn"" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was ""there to guide"" but that ""he wants to let it go and become its new generation"".\r\nThe Force Awakens\' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt. At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments. Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy. Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that ""every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn\'t care about your main character anymore."" The writers decided to use Luke as the film\'s MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene. Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel Star Wars: Bloodline).\r\nSeveral directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Jon Favreau, and Guillermo del Toro. Bird was reportedly ""top choice"" to helm the film, but his commitments to Tomorrowland forced him to withdraw. Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of X-Men: Days of Future Past in favor for the film. Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project. After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants. Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer. Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him. The production announced Arndt\'s exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties, both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said the key to the film was to the roots of the first Star Wars films and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.\r\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens, such as Rey and Finn\'s last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that ""we haven\'t mapped out every single detail yet"", but said that Abrams was collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with The Rise of Skywalker\'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that ""everybody\'s got a say in how we move forward with this"". Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.\r\nA fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series ""What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners""; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.\r\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been ""keen"" to involve him and conceded: ""If I get in there, I\'m just going to cause trouble because they\'re not going to do what I want them to do, and I don\'t have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up."" He also said, ""They wanted to do a retro movie. I don\'t like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new."" In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and ""liked it"". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, ""I think the fans are going to love it, It\'s very much the kind of movie they\'ve been looking for."" Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film ""needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain"" and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.\r\nPre-production\r\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that The Force Awakens would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in the UK. Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry. According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, The Force Awakens ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.\r\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of The Force Awakens for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States. The film\'s costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed. In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219). In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.\r\nCasting\r\nOpen auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of ""Rachel"" and ""Thomas"". Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams. Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement. Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013, their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.\r\nAbrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments. A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio, Zac Efron for a role. In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director. In January 2014, The Hollywood Reporter revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O\'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer. Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an ""Imperial commander"". Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film. Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker\'s son. In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role. In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams\' top choice for the lead role. Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic Race. That same month, Lupita Nyong\'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead. In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film. That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an ""unknown Oxford actress"", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles. Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey. Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part. Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.\r\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his Girls schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April. Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have ""bored"" him.\r\nIn April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy. In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong\'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced. To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke. Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist. Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO, but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him. A flashback scene was cut from Rey\'s vision (following her discovery of Luke\'s lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.\r\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film. In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in Return of the Jedi, as well as Wald and Weazle in The Phantom Menace (1999), announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens, but did not reveal his role. In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher\'s daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film. Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.\r\nFilming\r\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months. The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film. In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun, filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit. Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format. In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.\r\nPrincipal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014. The budget was reported to be between $259 million and $306 million. Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location—including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market—and where explosives were used to create a ""blast crater"". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming. Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.\r\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford\'s ankle ""went to a 90-degree angle"". Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford\'s injury. Ford\'s son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford\'s personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford\'s accident, but he kept this to himself for over a month. In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford\'s accident. Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.\r\nOn July 28, 2014 filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley. Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England. Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford\'s absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August. In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships. Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes. Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.\r\nPost-production\r\nKennedy said The Force Awakens would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery. Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: ""I think people are coming back around to. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick."" Abrams\' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors. The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original Star Wars film.\r\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney\'s Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM\'s Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film. Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions\' headquarters in Santa Monica. In August 2015, he gave the film\'s estimated running time of 124 minutes. Abrams made changes to the film\'s plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: ""At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value So we ended up leaving those things out."" The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.\r\nOn November 6, 2014, the film\'s title was announced as Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe, revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire ""for the longest time"".\r\nMusic\r\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with The Force Awakens. He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis. In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that ""there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way."" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.\r\nRecording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios\' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music. The first day of recording was June 1, 2015. Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.\r\nThe score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score\'s part for nearly an hour. Williams\' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men\'s chorus. Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams\' behest. Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015. The film\'s soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015. Williams\' score is more than two hours long.\r\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film\'s cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.\r\nMarketing\r\nPromotion\r\nDisney backed The Force Awakens with extensive marketing campaigns. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $175 million; its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423 million by The Guardian. On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store, generating 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week. Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. The Hollywood Reporter called the trailer ""perfectly potent nostalgia"", praising its mix of old and new. Empire was impressed by the continuity with the first films—""the feel of classic Star Wars""—but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters. The Guardian wrote that the use of the Star Wars fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.\r\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters. On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was ""staggering the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can\'t think of anything I\'ve ever been to—other than a rock concert—that felt quite like that"". The trailer was viewed over 88 million times within the first 24 hours of release. The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. The Huffington Post\'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer ""was an affirmation of something that we\'d long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.""\r\nVanity Fair was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to The Force Awakens. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz. At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film\'s use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian writing: ""The featurette\'s angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher\'s new look as Leia and Simon Pegg\'s mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action."" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, Super 8, saying ""the promos are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.""\r\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at The Force Awakens at Disney\'s D23 Expo in August 2015. Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous Star Wars films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event\'s attendees. In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like ""orb"". The trailer debuted during the halftime break of Monday Night Football, before being released online. The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was ""frenzied"", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that ""perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film\'s release is how little of the story it reveals."" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph felt the trailer was ""a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned Star Wars aesthetic"". The trailer received 128 million views in 24 hours. 16 million of the views came from its airing on Monday Night Football. At the end of October, Air France announced a ""Flight and Cinema"" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film. On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.\r\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a Star Wars marathon, airing the six previous Star Wars episode films in 2D, followed by The Force Awakens in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.\r\nTie-in literature and merchandise\r\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, ""Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film\'s premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the Star Wars universe. Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of The Force Awakens which was released in e-book form on December 18. In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film\'s release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016. Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of The Force Awakens between June and November 2016.\r\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed ""Force Friday"" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for The Force Awakens. Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world. Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015. Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero. Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling. Many retailers, such as Toys ""R"" Us, were unable to meet demand for Star Wars products due to the event.\r\nVideo games\r\nThe Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to not have a direct tie-in game to accompany it. Instead, select characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other Star Wars video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts; free downloadable content for Electronic Arts\' Star Wars Battlefront reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku; an update to the mobile game Star Wars Commander, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era; and a condensed version of the film\'s plot becomes an add-on ""playset"" in the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity 3.0, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters. Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre on December 14, 2015. A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the ""massive"" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests. The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015. It was also released in 3D and IMAX 3D formats.\r\nIn the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters, of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations, as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema. Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record. On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.\' The Hobbit trilogy to receive such a release. The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of The Revenant (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016) in mid-January 2016.\r\nAdvance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015, and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing. Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom\'s third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater. In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day. In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record. This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14. However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film\'s opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying ""people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening We have people buying Star Wars into 2016. It\'s not just an opening-weekend phenomenon."" Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK, Canada, and Germany.\r\nThe Force Awakens is the first live-action Star Wars film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company\'s logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman. Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm\'s production logo shown silently before the main titles. Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was ""for the fans"".\r\nA poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.\r\nHome media\r\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Star Wars: The Force Awakens through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews, and additional footage with eight bonus features. In its first week, The Force Awakens sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4 million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States. That same week, The Force Awakens topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray. Overall, The Force Awakens sold 2.1 million DVDs and 5.9 million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8 million copies, and made $191 million through home media releases.\r\nA Blu-ray 3D ""collector\'s edition"" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams. The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features. In 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, containing the nine films in the series, with each film on three discs, a Blu-ray version, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and special features found on the 2011 release for the first six episodic films.\r\nBroadcast syndication\r\nThe premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for The Force Awakens in January 2016, just before the end of Starz\'s output deal covering most Disney films through 2015. That September, The Force Awakens began broadcasting on all Starz networks.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens grossed $936.7 million in the United States and Canada and $1.132 billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068 billion, making it the highest-grossing film of 2015 and the third highest-grossing film of all time. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110 million tickets in the United States and Canada. The Force Awakens earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by Titanic in 1997. It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days. It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film\'s net profit as $780.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015\'s ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"".\r\nCommercial analysis\r\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made. It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.\r\nWhile The Force Awakens was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being ""a retro film"" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America. The Star Wars franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that market.\r\nNancy Tartaglione of Deadline Hollywood argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, The Force Awakens did well overseas. While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Dergarabedian stated, ""No matter what, is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones."" Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of Deadline Hollywood argued that the movie was the ""most valuable movie"" of the year, with ""the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film, at 2.00"".\r\nUnited States and Canada\r\nIn the United States and Canada, The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews, of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens. On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day. Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross and a record of $247.9 million for its opening weekend. The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders The Avengers (2012) ($207 million) and Jurassic World (2015) ($208 million). The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters, which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by Return of the Jedi—the second-lowest-grossing film in the series—in its original run. 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record. At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012). It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) six years later. Revenues in the film\'s second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.\r\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following Avatar) to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada, and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days. On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation. On February 5, The Force Awakens became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada. The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016, and did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.\r\nOther territories\r\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens. It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them. It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets. It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day, and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million. It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million), Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million), and in 12 other countries. Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million) and Japan ($3 million). After the five days, The Force Awakens had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening and the third-biggest international opening of all time. International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million), Japan ($13.4 million), and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.\r\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history—after Jurassic World—that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally. This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million. Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 11 days. IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters. The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million. The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million. As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million), and France ($88.2 million). On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat. It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by The Revenant in its sixth weekend. In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.\r\nCritical response\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 447 critics\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website\'s consensus reads, ""Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series\' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an ""A+"", while 98% of audiences gave it either an ""A"" or a ""B"". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% ""definite recommend"" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.\r\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph said the film ""sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past"", and ""it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said that it was ""both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot"", and it was ""ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity."" Variety\'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has ""sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as ""a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure"". Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, thought the film had ""enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans"", and the film struck ""all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new."" The Charlotte Observer\'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had ""pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past."" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating and called it ""the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015"". Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and that it ""is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike"".\r\nCertain critics found The Force Awakens derivative of the original Star Wars trilogy, some expressing their opinion that the film was essentially a remake of A New Hope. Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves ""the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind"", with ""the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction been recaptured"". The Tribune-Star called it ""basically the same"" as the original film but ""isn\'t that what we all wanted anyway?"" Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Abrams had delivered ""everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn\'t know we wanted"". Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film\'s ""top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope"", but felt it was so much ""an exercise in fan service it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams\' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn\'t outright destroy the picture."" Brian Merchant of Motherboard said that the film ""is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod"", and that ""one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot."" RogerEbert.com\'s Gerardo Valero went as far as to accuse the film of plagiarizing A New Hope and resorting to nostalgia. He felt that it ""didn\'t a return to the universe"" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas\' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.\r\nFrom Star Wars filmmakers\r\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a ""divorce"" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of The Force Awakens. Lucas described the previous Star Wars films as his ""children"" and criticized the ""retro feel"" of The Force Awakens, saying: ""I worked very hard to make completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships—you know, to make it new."" Lucas also likened Disney to ""white slavers"", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized. In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas ""couldn\'t even hide his disappointment"" towards J. J. Abrams\' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, ""there\'s nothing new"" after seeing the film, and that ""there weren\'t enough visual or technical leaps forward"". Lucas preferred Rian Johnson\'s sequel The Last Jedi and the anthology film Rogue One (2016).\r\nIn 2016, when directly confronted about Lucas\' complaints of The Force Awakens being too derivative of previous films, Abrams said, ""What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new – to go backwards to go forwards"". In 2019, Abrams apologized for how he handled Chewbacca and Leia\'s meeting after Han Solo\'s death, noting that Han Solo\'s best friend and widow ignore each other, with Leia instead hugging Rey (whom Leia is meeting for the first time). Johnson\'s sequel included Leia hugging Chewbacca at the end of The Last Jedi as a way to apologize for the previous film\'s oversight. After being confronted about The Force Awakens, Abrams further apologized about it, saying he ""wished it would have been Lucas\' favorite movie"", and that he was ""grateful for Lucas"", while understanding his complaints about the film being highly derivative of A New Hope. Abrams also said the scene of Starkiller Base destroying a solar system would have had a similar emotional impact to the Death Star destroying planet Alderaan in the original film, had he not chosen to delete scenes of a character who Leia interacted with, prior to the deleted character dying on one of the exploding planets.\r\nJohnson\'s initial response to the script of The Force Awakens included the suggestion of minor adjustments to the ending. According to Abrams, these improved the movie and made it line up more with The Last Jedi. Abrams intended for BB-8 to help Rey search for Luke, which Johnson changed to R2-D2 (due to being Luke\'s droid, as well as BB-8 belonging to Poe and not knowing Luke). Additionally, Abrams\' ending featured Rey finding Luke lifting rocks with the Force, which was changed due to Johnson\'s plot of Luke having disconnected himself from the Force. In 2019, in another response to the criticisms towards The Force Awakens, Abrams stated that Rian Johnson advised him ""not to just do something that you\'ve seen before."" In the same interview, Abrams said that he liked Snoke\'s death in the sequel. He also said that Johnson\'s boldness of The Last Jedi, mainly in his choice of Snoke\'s death, inspired him to be more original when returning for The Rise of Skywalker. Abrams also has affirmed his dedication not to retroactively release alternate versions of the films, saying, ""I feel like you\'re done with a thing, ... that\'s what it is.""\r\nAccolades\r\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of The Force Awakens, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies. However, the film was added to the 21st Critics\' Choice Awards\' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors, and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of The Force Awakens, where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.\r\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, The Force Awakens received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. The film\'s other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics\' Choice Movie Award.\r\nSequels\r\nThe Force Awakens was followed by The Last Jedi in 2017. The film\'s plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order. Like the previous film, The Last Jedi was a financial success and fared well with critics.\r\nA sequel to The Last Jedi was released in 2019, titled The Rise of Skywalker. As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative, it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order. Critics\' reactions to The Rise of Skywalker were mixed.', 'html': '<p>Star Wars: The Force Awakens (also known as Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens) is a 2015 American epic space opera film produced, co-written, and directed by J. J. Abrams. The sequel to Return of the Jedi (1983), it is the seventh film in the ""Skywalker Saga"". Set thirty years after Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo\'s search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire.

The film is the first Star Wars film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. The Force Awakens was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 on a $259–306 million budget and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland.</p><p>The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics for its screenplay, direction, lead performances, action sequences, musical score, special effects, and emotional weight, although some critics found the film too similar to A New Hope (1977). The film grossed $2 billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was nominated for five awards at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The Last Jedi (2017) and The Rise of Skywalker (2019) followed The Force Awakens, rounding out the Star Wars sequel trilogy.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who has gone missing.</p><p>On the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke\'s location from Lor San Tekka. Stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village and capture Poe, ultimately killing San Tekka and slaughtering the villagers. Poe\'s droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned by the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name ""Finn"". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and finds only Poe\'s jacket in the wreck, leading to the assumption of his death. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon and escape the planet.</p><p>The Falcon is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the Falcon. At the First Order\'s Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux\'s request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo\'s ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.</p><p>Aboard the Falcon, Han determines that BB-8\'s map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds the lightsaber once belonging to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz\'s offering, and flees into the woods, confused and terrified. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.</p><p>Starkiller Base demostrates its power by simultaneously destroying the New Republic capital of Hosnian Prime and four of its neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a Stormtrooper guard.</p><p>At the Resistance base on D\'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been inactive since Luke\'s disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han instead. Devastated, Chewbacca shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base\'s thermal oscillator.</p><p>The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods. Kylo incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is overcome due to his lack of experience. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel; they are then separated by a fissure as the planet\'s surface begins to splinter. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the Falcon. As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which points to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.</p><p>Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 travel to Ahch-To on the Falcon. Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island. Without a word, she presents him with his father\'s lightsaber.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Harrison Ford as Han Solo: A smuggler and captain of the Millennium Falcon</li><li>Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker: The last Jedi, who has gone into hiding</li><li>Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa: A leader of the Resistance</li><li>Adam Driver as Kylo Ren: A leader of the Knights of Ren and the commander of the First Order, who is the son of Han and Leia</li><li>Daisy Ridley as Rey: A Force-sensitive scavengerCailey Fleming as young Rey</li><li>Cailey Fleming as young Rey</li><li>John Boyega as Finn: A reformed First Order stormtrooper</li><li>Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron: A high-ranking X-wing fighter pilot of the Resistance</li><li>Lupita Nyong\'o as Maz Kanata: A centuries-old and perceptive alien who owns a castle on the peaceful forest planet Takodana</li><li>Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke: A enigmatic, artificially genetic leader of the First Order</li><li>Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux: The commander of the First Order\'s Starkiller Base</li><li>Anthony Daniels as C-3PO: A humanoid protocol droid</li><li>Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca: Han\'s loyal Wookiee friend and co-pilotJoonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems</li><li>Joonas Suotamo and Ian Whyte served as body doubles for Mayhew as he suffered from health problems</li><li>Max von Sydow as Lor San Tekka: A galactic explorer searching for Luke Skywalker</li></ul><p>Tim Rose and Mike Quinn reprise their respective roles as Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb from Return of the Jedi, with Erik Bauersfeld and Kipsang Rotich returning their respective voices.

In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company. Speaking alongside Lucasfilm\'s new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: ""I always said I wasn\'t going to do any more and that\'s true, because I\'m not going to do any more, but that doesn\'t mean I\'m unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.""</p><p>As creative consultant on the film, Lucas attended early story meetings and advised on the details of the Star Wars universe. Among the materials he turned over to the production team were his rough story treatments for Episodes VII–IX, which Lucas requested be read only by Kennedy, Bob Iger, Alan F. Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer. Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film. Lucas\' son Jett told The Guardian that his father was ""very torn"" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was ""there to guide"" but that ""he wants to let it go and become its new generation"".</p><p>The Force Awakens\' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt. At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments. Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy. Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that ""every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn\'t care about your main character anymore."" The writers decided to use Luke as the film\'s MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene. Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel Star Wars: Bloodline).</p><p>Several directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Jon Favreau, and Guillermo del Toro. Bird was reportedly ""top choice"" to helm the film, but his commitments to Tomorrowland forced him to withdraw. Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of X-Men: Days of Future Past in favor for the film. Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project. After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants. Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer. Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him. The production announced Arndt\'s exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties, both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said the key to the film was to the roots of the first Star Wars films and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.</p><p>Abrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from The Force Awakens, such as Rey and Finn\'s last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that ""we haven\'t mapped out every single detail yet"", but said that Abrams was collaborating with The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with The Rise of Skywalker\'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that ""everybody\'s got a say in how we move forward with this"". Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.</p><p>A fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series ""What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners""; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.</p><p>In November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been ""keen"" to involve him and conceded: ""If I get in there, I\'m just going to cause trouble because they\'re not going to do what I want them to do, and I don\'t have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up."" He also said, ""They wanted to do a retro movie. I don\'t like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new."" In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and ""liked it"". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, ""I think the fans are going to love it, It\'s very much the kind of movie they\'ve been looking for."" Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film ""needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain"" and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.</p><h4>Pre-production</h4><p>In May 2013, it was confirmed that The Force Awakens would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce The Force Awakens in the UK. Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry. According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, The Force Awakens ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.</p><p>Beginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of The Force Awakens for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States. The film\'s costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed. In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219). In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>Open auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of ""Rachel"" and ""Thomas"". Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams. Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement. Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013, their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.</p><p>Abrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments. A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio, Zac Efron for a role. In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director. In January 2014, The Hollywood Reporter revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O\'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer. Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an ""Imperial commander"". Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film. Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker\'s son. In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role. In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams\' top choice for the lead role. Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic Race. That same month, Lupita Nyong\'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead. In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film. That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an ""unknown Oxford actress"", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles. Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey. Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part. Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.</p><p>Daisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his Girls schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April. Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have ""bored"" him.</p><p>In April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy. In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong\'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced. To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke. Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist. Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO, but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him. A flashback scene was cut from Rey\'s vision (following her discovery of Luke\'s lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p>In May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the Star Wars set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film. In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in Return of the Jedi, as well as Wald and Weazle in The Phantom Menace (1999), announced that he would appear in The Force Awakens, but did not reveal his role. In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher\'s daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film. Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.</p><h4>Filming</h4><p>In February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months. The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film. In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun, filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit. Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format. In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.</p><p>Principal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014. The budget was reported to be between $259 million and $306 million. Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location—including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market—and where explosives were used to create a ""blast crater"". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming. Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.</p><p>That same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the Millennium Falcon set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford\'s ankle ""went to a 90-degree angle"". Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford\'s injury. Ford\'s son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford\'s personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford\'s accident, but he kept this to himself for over a month. In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford\'s accident. Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.</p><p>On July 28, 2014 filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley. Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England. Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford\'s absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August. In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships. Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes. Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.</p><h4>Post-production</h4><p>Kennedy said The Force Awakens would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery. Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: ""I think people are coming back around to. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick."" Abrams\' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors. The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original Star Wars film.</p><p>In February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney\'s Star Wars films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM\'s Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film. Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions\' headquarters in Santa Monica. In August 2015, he gave the film\'s estimated running time of 124 minutes. Abrams made changes to the film\'s plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: ""At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value So we ended up leaving those things out."" The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.</p><p>On November 6, 2014, the film\'s title was announced as Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe, revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire ""for the longest time"".</p><h4>Music</h4><p>In July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with The Force Awakens. He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis. In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that ""there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way."" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.</p><p>Recording sessions for The Force Awakens began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios\' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music. The first day of recording was June 1, 2015. Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.</p><p>The score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score\'s part for nearly an hour. Williams\' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men\'s chorus. Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams\' behest. Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015. The film\'s soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015. Williams\' score is more than two hours long.</p><p>Lin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film\'s cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical Hamilton, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.</p><br/><h3>Marketing</h3><h4>Promotion</h4><p>Disney backed The Force Awakens with extensive marketing campaigns. Deadline Hollywood estimated the media value was $175 million; its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423 million by The Guardian. On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store, generating 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week. Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. The Hollywood Reporter called the trailer ""perfectly potent nostalgia"", praising its mix of old and new. Empire was impressed by the continuity with the first films—""the feel of classic Star Wars""—but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters. The Guardian wrote that the use of the Star Wars fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.</p><p>On December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters. On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was ""staggering the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can\'t think of anything I\'ve ever been to—other than a rock concert—that felt quite like that"". The trailer was viewed over 88 million times within the first 24 hours of release. The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. The Huffington Post\'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer ""was an affirmation of something that we\'d long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.""</p><p>Vanity Fair was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to The Force Awakens. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz. At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film\'s use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian writing: ""The featurette\'s angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher\'s new look as Leia and Simon Pegg\'s mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action."" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, Super 8, saying ""the promos are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.""</p><p>Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at The Force Awakens at Disney\'s D23 Expo in August 2015. Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous Star Wars films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event\'s attendees. In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like ""orb"". The trailer debuted during the halftime break of Monday Night Football, before being released online. The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was ""frenzied"", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that ""perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film\'s release is how little of the story it reveals."" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph felt the trailer was ""a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned Star Wars aesthetic"". The trailer received 128 million views in 24 hours. 16 million of the views came from its airing on Monday Night Football. At the end of October, Air France announced a ""Flight and Cinema"" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film. On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.</p><p>On December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a Star Wars marathon, airing the six previous Star Wars episode films in 2D, followed by The Force Awakens in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.</p><h4>Tie-in literature and merchandise</h4><p>Disney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, ""Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film\'s premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the Star Wars universe. Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of The Force Awakens which was released in e-book form on December 18. In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film\'s release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016. Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of The Force Awakens between June and November 2016.</p><p>Disney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed ""Force Friday"" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for The Force Awakens. Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world. Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015. Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero. Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling. Many retailers, such as Toys ""R"" Us, were unable to meet demand for Star Wars products due to the event.</p><h4>Video games</h4><p>The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to not have a direct tie-in game to accompany it. Instead, select characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other Star Wars video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts; free downloadable content for Electronic Arts\' Star Wars Battlefront reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku; an update to the mobile game Star Wars Commander, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era; and a condensed version of the film\'s plot becomes an add-on ""playset"" in the toys-to-life game Disney Infinity 3.0, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters. Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Star Wars: The Force Awakens premiered in Los Angeles at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre on December 14, 2015. A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the ""massive"" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests. The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015. It was also released in 3D and IMAX 3D formats.</p><p>In the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters, of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations, as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema. Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record. On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.\' The Hobbit trilogy to receive such a release. The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of The Revenant (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016) in mid-January 2016.</p><p>Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015, and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing. Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom\'s third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater. In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day. In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record. This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14. However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film\'s opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying ""people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening We have people buying Star Wars into 2016. It\'s not just an opening-weekend phenomenon."" Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK, Canada, and Germany.</p><p>The Force Awakens is the first live-action Star Wars film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company\'s logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman. Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm\'s production logo shown silently before the main titles. Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was ""for the fans"".</p><p>A poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Star Wars: The Force Awakens through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews, and additional footage with eight bonus features. In its first week, The Force Awakens sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4 million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States. That same week, The Force Awakens topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray. Overall, The Force Awakens sold 2.1 million DVDs and 5.9 million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8 million copies, and made $191 million through home media releases.</p><p>A Blu-ray 3D ""collector\'s edition"" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams. The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features. In 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, containing the nine films in the series, with each film on three discs, a Blu-ray version, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and special features found on the 2011 release for the first six episodic films.</p><h4>Broadcast syndication</h4><p>The premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for The Force Awakens in January 2016, just before the end of Starz\'s output deal covering most Disney films through 2015. That September, The Force Awakens began broadcasting on all Starz networks.</p><br/><h3>Reception</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed $936.7 million in the United States and Canada and $1.132 billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068 billion, making it the highest-grossing film of 2015 and the third highest-grossing film of all time. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110 million tickets in the United States and Canada. The Force Awakens earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by Titanic in 1997. It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days. It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film\'s net profit as $780.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015\'s ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"".</p><h4>Commercial analysis</h4><p>Analysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first Star Wars film made more when this adjustment is made. It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.</p><p>While The Force Awakens was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being ""a retro film"" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America. The Star Wars franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for The Force Awakens heavily focused on appealing to that market.</p><p>Nancy Tartaglione of Deadline Hollywood argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, The Force Awakens did well overseas. While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done. Dergarabedian stated, ""No matter what, is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones."" Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of Deadline Hollywood argued that the movie was the ""most valuable movie"" of the year, with ""the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film, at 2.00"".</p><h4>United States and Canada</h4><p>In the United States and Canada, The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews, of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens. On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day. Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross and a record of $247.9 million for its opening weekend. The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders The Avengers (2012) ($207 million) and Jurassic World (2015) ($208 million). The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters, which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by Return of the Jedi—the second-lowest-grossing film in the series—in its original run. 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record. At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012). It would hold this record until it was surpassed by Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) six years later. Revenues in the film\'s second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.</p><p>On January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following Avatar) to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada, and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days. On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation. On February 5, The Force Awakens became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada. The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016, and did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.</p><h4>Other territories</h4><p>Internationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens. It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them. It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets. It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day, and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million. It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million), Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million), and in 12 other countries. Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million) and Japan ($3 million). After the five days, The Force Awakens had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening and the third-biggest international opening of all time. International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million), Japan ($13.4 million), and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.</p><p>After five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history—after Jurassic World—that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally. This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million. Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 11 days. IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters. The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million. The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million. As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million), and France ($88.2 million). On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat. It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by The Revenant in its sixth weekend. In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.</p><h4>Critical response</h4><p>Star Wars: The Force Awakens received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 447 critics\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website\'s consensus reads, ""Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series\' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an ""A+"", while 98% of audiences gave it either an ""A"" or a ""B"". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% ""definite recommend"" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph said the film ""sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past"", and ""it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said that it was ""both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot"", and it was ""ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity."" Variety\'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has ""sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans."" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as ""a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure"". Ann Hornaday, writing for The Washington Post, thought the film had ""enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans"", and the film struck ""all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new."" The Charlotte Observer\'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had ""pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past."" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film his highest rating and called it ""the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015"". Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy and that it ""is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike"".</p><p>Certain critics found The Force Awakens derivative of the original Star Wars trilogy, some expressing their opinion that the film was essentially a remake of A New Hope. Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves ""the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind"", with ""the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction been recaptured"". The Tribune-Star called it ""basically the same"" as the original film but ""isn\'t that what we all wanted anyway?"" Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Abrams had delivered ""everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn\'t know we wanted"". Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film\'s ""top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope"", but felt it was so much ""an exercise in fan service it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams\' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn\'t outright destroy the picture."" Brian Merchant of Motherboard said that the film ""is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod"", and that ""one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot."" RogerEbert.com\'s Gerardo Valero went as far as to accuse the film of plagiarizing A New Hope and resorting to nostalgia. He felt that it ""didn\'t a return to the universe"" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas\' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.</p><h4>From Star Wars filmmakers</h4><p>In an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a ""divorce"" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of The Force Awakens. Lucas described the previous Star Wars films as his ""children"" and criticized the ""retro feel"" of The Force Awakens, saying: ""I worked very hard to make completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships—you know, to make it new."" Lucas also likened Disney to ""white slavers"", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized. In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas ""couldn\'t even hide his disappointment"" towards J. J. Abrams\' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, ""there\'s nothing new"" after seeing the film, and that ""there weren\'t enough visual or technical leaps forward"". Lucas preferred Rian Johnson\'s sequel The Last Jedi and the anthology film Rogue One (2016).</p><p>In 2016, when directly confronted about Lucas\' complaints of The Force Awakens being too derivative of previous films, Abrams said, ""What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new – to go backwards to go forwards"". In 2019, Abrams apologized for how he handled Chewbacca and Leia\'s meeting after Han Solo\'s death, noting that Han Solo\'s best friend and widow ignore each other, with Leia instead hugging Rey (whom Leia is meeting for the first time). Johnson\'s sequel included Leia hugging Chewbacca at the end of The Last Jedi as a way to apologize for the previous film\'s oversight. After being confronted about The Force Awakens, Abrams further apologized about it, saying he ""wished it would have been Lucas\' favorite movie"", and that he was ""grateful for Lucas"", while understanding his complaints about the film being highly derivative of A New Hope. Abrams also said the scene of Starkiller Base destroying a solar system would have had a similar emotional impact to the Death Star destroying planet Alderaan in the original film, had he not chosen to delete scenes of a character who Leia interacted with, prior to the deleted character dying on one of the exploding planets.</p><p>Johnson\'s initial response to the script of The Force Awakens included the suggestion of minor adjustments to the ending. According to Abrams, these improved the movie and made it line up more with The Last Jedi. Abrams intended for BB-8 to help Rey search for Luke, which Johnson changed to R2-D2 (due to being Luke\'s droid, as well as BB-8 belonging to Poe and not knowing Luke). Additionally, Abrams\' ending featured Rey finding Luke lifting rocks with the Force, which was changed due to Johnson\'s plot of Luke having disconnected himself from the Force. In 2019, in another response to the criticisms towards The Force Awakens, Abrams stated that Rian Johnson advised him ""not to just do something that you\'ve seen before."" In the same interview, Abrams said that he liked Snoke\'s death in the sequel. He also said that Johnson\'s boldness of The Last Jedi, mainly in his choice of Snoke\'s death, inspired him to be more original when returning for The Rise of Skywalker. Abrams also has affirmed his dedication not to retroactively release alternate versions of the films, saying, ""I feel like you\'re done with a thing, ... that\'s what it is.""</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>Several awards held their nominations before the December release of The Force Awakens, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies. However, the film was added to the 21st Critics\' Choice Awards\' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors, and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of The Force Awakens, where it was named one of Top Ten Films of the year.</p><p>At the 88th Academy Awards, The Force Awakens received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. The film\'s other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics\' Choice Movie Award.</p><br/><h3>Sequels</h3><p>The Force Awakens was followed by The Last Jedi in 2017. The film\'s plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order. Like the previous film, The Last Jedi was a financial success and fared well with critics.</p><p>A sequel to The Last Jedi was released in 2019, titled The Rise of Skywalker. As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative, it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order. Critics\' reactions to The Rise of Skywalker were mixed.</p><br/>'}, 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt2488496', 'title': 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens', 'fullTitle': 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '2015', 'posters': [], 'backdrops': [], 'errorMessage': ''}","{'imDbId': 'tt2488496', 'title': 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens', 'fullTitle': 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)', 'type': 'Movie', 'year': '2015', 'videoId': 'vi2762323481', 'videoTitle': 'Watch With a STARZ Free Trial', 'videoDescription': 'Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises.
